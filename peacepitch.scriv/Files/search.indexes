            <Text>The purpose of this sub-piece is to set the stage, in a grand sense.

There exist two primary forms of physical simplicity. One type, it defines our past--the other, our future. These terms however are strictly relative to the present. As it turns out, we happen to live in this awkward space somewhere in between.

Our notion of this physical simplicity in the past originated at a moment we refer to as the big bang. The big bang is a type of singularity. At this singularity, all the stuff we know and love was all bunched into a point, undifferentiated. Beyond this point--beyond the beginning of linear time--our modern physics breaks down entirely.

Our notion of this physical simplicity in the future is more of an extremely well informed prediction for a similar point in linear time. (This means that instead of a preponderance of evidence that something happened, we have a preponderance of evidence that something will happen.) At this singular point in the future however, all stuff isn't perfectly packed into a point. Instead, all stuff is perfectly spread out, a singular smear. This moment marks the end of linear time, and we refer to this moment as the heat death of the universe. Beyond this point--the end of linear time--our physics has nothing left to say. (Physicists chose this name because at this moment our physics says it will be impossible for anything new and interesting to happen, so everything is dead.)

When I say linear time in this sub-peace, I mean something very specific. I am referring to the fourth dimension of Einstein's general relativity (which is so far accepted as the best proven description of the physical reality at a cosmological scale). This fourth dimension of time is effectively equivalent to any one of the three spatial dimensions we are all familiar with, being up-down, left-right, forward-backward. This fourth dimension is exactly what you generally think of when you think time passes.

The reason I say it is effectively equivalent to space is that time in general relativity (and the original classical physics' sense) differs qualitatively from regular space in one massive way: time has the quality of directionality, something we like to call the arrow of time. The name arrow of time should evoke exactly what it sounds like, that time as we know it is uni-directional. I use uni-directional to mean that time is irreversible.

(And for you physicist firing back with your nigh impossible edge case possibilities, may I remind you, this treatment refers to what we have a preponderance of evidence for. Just because reversibility is theoretically possible with some incomprehensibly small likelihood, does not mean reversibility should be declared possible for the sake of this conversation.)

Time is irreversible, and the catch? We have zero agreed-on clue as to why this is. This is one of the two great mysteries of modern Humans' understanding of physical reality (the other being to explain why subjective experience feels the way it feels, or the hard problem of consciousness). We know that stuff in the past is less spread out than stuff in the future. The big bang is a moment where everything is condensed into a point, and the heat death of the universe is a moment where everything is spread out into a smear. When you pop a balloon, the helium molecules immediately spread out in a way that cannot be reversed thus, one cannot un-pop a balloon. Time = start in that example is the moment the balloon is popped, and time = future is when those balloon molecules keep spreading out more and more. Even the rubber of the balloon will disintegrate as time passes, and the constituent molecules will spread out as time goes on.

As it turns out, what I have described above about the arrow of time is formally expressed by what we call the second law of thermodynamics. The second law of thermodynamics is a mathematical expression of the arrow of time that the entropy of the universe increases as time goes on. (Entropy is basically a concept from physics that lets us measure how spread out stuff is. Low entropy means stuff is more condensed, and high entropy means stuff is more spread out. Your bedroom when its clean is in a state of low entropy relative to when your bedroom is a total mess, which is a state of higher entropy.) I introduce the term entropy and thermodynamics to point out to you that the second law of thermodynamics is perhaps the best-verified law of modern physics to date. This is why we call it a law.

This paragraphs above are to set the stage for the point: to restate, we Humans exist in a place in between the big band and the heat death of the universe. Now we introduce a paradox: despite the unavoidable tendency for stuff to spread out (and die) as time goes on, we look at life forms like ourselves and those that surround us and we realize that they all temporarily violate the second law of thermodynamics. If we look at Humanity as a whole--as a species--we appear to be growing into a larger, singular more complex whole. Within the scope of our existence as a life form, something keeps increasing within the Human universe, and this is not entropy.

Complexity is the essence of this increasing quantity. As long as we have the resources at our disposal (and as long as we don't decimate our edifice with nuclear holocaust, as long as we survive global warming, etc), we continuously increase in complexity. The more our society, technology, culture, institutions, etc, complexifies, the more we realize that the rate seems to have no apparent upper bound. (Though it could very well be that the rate is a function of population size and interconnectivity, in a combinatorial sense.)

Along these lines, it also seems that complexity is related to consciousness. Consciousness seems to emerge as a product of living organisms complexifying enough to develop brain. As we Humanity continue to complexify, we are beginning to notice the emergence of higher levels of collective awareness. We look at our global information exchange networks, and people themselves take on an almost neuronal quality. On this same note, but much much darker, the more we complexify and the more aware we become, the more problems that we seem to face and more intense they are. This begs a question:

Why do problems exist? The deepest response to this question (while still remaining grounded in the world of scientific reason) is that people exist. (To be more accurate, living organisms with brains exist.) Take a closer look at this statement in the context of above. Clearly the motion, formation, destruction of celestial bodies on the cosmic scale is not a problem. This is just the natural evolution of stuff. Besides, planets devoid of life do not have brains present.

One thing we know for certain about brains is that they give the owners the ability to exercise free won't, the ability to exercise restraint, the extent of which depending on the complexity of the brain. (Free won't is the appropriate phrase simply because if all a conscious organism does is what it wants, then this is no different than reflex, instinct, like the celestial bodies. It is generally agreed that consciousness is something that free agents possess.) For different organisms with less developed brains (well, Humans too), free won't is generally mediated by fear. Ultimately this harks back to the evolutionary principle that organisms with brains that make the best moves or decisions are the organisms that survive well enough procreate. (Naturally, there are pathological cases of this however.)

There are a lot a big assumptions and statements packed into the last two paragraphs. For our purposes it doesn't really matter how valid they are. This sub-piece is to tell one possible version of a story.

Point is, if people didn't exist, if brains didn't exist, if higher consciousness didn't exist, then problems as Humans understand the word would not exist.

People are the problem. People have the brains. Technology isn't the problem, because it doesn't have brains. Resource scarcity isn't the problem, because resources are not free agents with brain. You will be hard pressed to identify a Human problem that does not ultimately trace back to decisions made by Human brains. In fact, I am arguing that this is impossible.

So we set the stage for a discussion about resource scarcity. If we didn't exist, we wouldn't have problems. But self-extinction is not an option. (It might be for the chronically depressed, but not the rest of us.)

It's pretty easy to argue that time is the most scarce of the resource trifecta: people, time, and energy.

All the other resource scarcities exist because the wheels of capitalism place profit and stuff on a pedestal. In particular, we have a marketplace--an exchange--where we trade our scarce time for money, which we use to survive; we have a ruling class of wealthy elite incentivized by profit to keep things as they are; we have a people who at the most can buy stuff with their money, often without the time to use; we have a people who demand stuff at lower and lower price, because like time, money becomes scarce, too; we have an obsession with plastic, automobiles, electricity, in other words, fossil fuels.

Aside: you and I don't have a time machine, so we have no choice about capitalism becoming as it is. We have choice moving forward, but we have to assume that something about the emergent nature of capitalism provided something we need, say, like the development of a technological foundation that provides the electricity, medicine, transportation, agriculture, information exchange network, etc, that we demand of society. If I were to suggest that I could undo capitalism but we had to give up electricity, medicine, transportation, agriculture, networking technology, etc, this simply would not be entertained by nearly all of us. If you suggest, 'go ahead, I'll just live off the land', you are failing to realize that the bare land alone is no longer capable of sustaining our current world population, and you would be sentencing--probably the majority--of fellow Humans to an extremely unpleasant demise.

Ok, so say we focus only on what we can do in the future to peacefully introduce a new form of economy, one more sustainable and Humane--say we stop obsessing over the past which we cannot change. Ok, so let's evolve our ways.

The problem is scarcity of time, not our resolve; we have the resolve we need. Time scarcity boils down into three aspects: absolute, people, and energy.

Working backward, say we all find the time to evolve our ways, we quickly find that the big problem is coordinating energy, or different kinds of time. When I have the time, you have the time, and we are together, one or both of us might not have any energy. I may have the energy to work on our evolution with creativity and vigor, but you may be too tired from your long day at work and the issues at home you have been trying to resolve. In this case, I need you for the project we are working on, but you don't have the energy to help like you need. You are experiencing energy scarcity. Or, perhaps we both have the raw energy, but our energies are of different type. I may have darker angry aggressive energy, while you have lighter creative energy. We have plenty of energy, but these energies may be incompatible so we likely will not get much done.

From the other direction, when we have compatible energy, we may be inaccessible to one another. I may be feeling creative and I may need your input in the moment because you are feeling creative lately, but you are asleep and unreachable. I may find that this case of people scarcity impedes my ability to get anything done. Or, on a deeper plane, I may need to draw from the wisdom of somebody in my family who has passed away. Such person is permanently scarce, and I may be limited by their ability to have left behind record of their legacy, beliefs, knowledge, wisdom. Less deep, I may need the expertise of somebody that I do not know, or do not know even exists. I am limited by the scarcity of somebody I know not that I need.

Both these scarcities are not limited to matching types, rather they are limited in the opposite sense from matching. I may be feeling light and creative, but I actually need some destructive energy to whittle down my creative work. If all I get is light and creative, then I never get the chance to really refine my work. Likewise with people, I may think I need somebody scarce to get things done, but really I would be better off if that scarce person were not present.

Energy scarcity and people scarcity relate to time in that eliminating these scarcities depends on our ability to coordinate the different kinds of time that these scarcity types represent. If we think of defining our time in terms of separate dimensions representing the energies and people that define moments, then the problem to solve is to find the best way to match these different times with each other. This means coordinating people among those four dimensions of general relativity--time and 3d space, or spacetime.

Now say hypothetically we find a way to perfectly coordinate our scarce energies and people. Even then we still have the most important scarcity, that being absolute time scarcity. Even when everything is just right, we just don't have enough time! This is because there is only so much time in a day, and because we are incentivized to sell our time in the labor market, usually for labor that has nothing to do with our resolve to evolve our social/economic/political institutions and improve our Human Condition. To put this obviously, we never have enough time when we need it. (You might have the inclination to point out that three dimensional space is an equally scarce resource as time. This is not so, mainly due to the fact we have the technological ability to coordinate time among people who are geographically distributed. Also, besides capacity, sharing a single space is limited by how much time we have to take turns.)

Without the time, we have not the ability to effectively and efficiently coordinate ways to educate, innovate, and overcome the scarcities of other--more mundane--resources such as fossil fuels, minerals, water, money, etc. If we insist that self-extinction is not an option, then we must accept the fact that all of our problems revolve around time. Time is the problem.

Time.

What would a practical, general solution to this fact look like (as constrained above)? I argue it would look like this:

In a perfect world (but grounded in reality), we would find a technological and social system capable of optimizing the timing and unification of our different energies and people. We would find that such a system was made possible by creating a special purpose language, physics, mathematics devoted to recognizing time as multidimensional, dimensions including energy types and people. We would find that in general we tend to think explicitly in terms of time, energy, and people scarcity.

By the thesis from the education | language | consilience essay &lt;&lt;insert location here&gt;&gt;, by the Sapir-Wharf hypothesis such a time management system would work primarily because the language we use revolves around time, and this would change the way we think (and maybe even rewire our individuals brains, appealing to neuroplasticity and the strong form of the Sapir-Wharf hypothesis). Further, on a collective level, a physics and mathematics  revolving around time would change the way we see technology and innovate as a species.

But time is the enemy. We would not really want to frame everything we do in terms of the thing that causes our problems, because this would be similar to living in fear. Instead we would be inclined to frame every thing we do in terms of our goal for solving our problems, for solving time. That goal, simply, is peace. To solve a Human problem is to make peace with a situation. We would find that by framing everything we do in terms of peace, our language would naturally focus on time as a product of this, but only in the context of our positive goal.

This book is about what such a system or machine would look like. Due to the immensity of such a creative endeavor, it would involve some form of a computer, a tool to help us manage the massive creative effort. There will be a multitude of pieces involved, worlds too. Speaking descriptively, this effort would involve world piece computers, in a way that forms a network. We could define the overall system as the universal piece computer, due to the fact that all worlds are different and the network's glue would be something universally common. This glue I argue, is to treat peace as a computational process. We could define this computational peace process as the universal piece.

If time is the root of all our problems, and our problems distress us (as they should), then peace is the common concept that we can all relate to wanting, be you peacelike or warlike (as war is generally the destructive pursuit of peace). Peace as a process is fitting, because process implies change or movement, which is the basis of time.

It would serve us to name the time management system outlined above. This is the time machine for peace, a system or machine (social, technological, economic, political, ...) that deliberately, methodically--effectively--empowers us to get to the best future we can imagine. The first component of the time machine for peace is general piece computer, applied to individual worlds as world piece computers and applied to the sum of our worlds as a whole, being the universal piece computer.

Let's invent the piece computer. And ideally, let's make it a good time.

            <Text>A statement to the people of The United States of America

I am American. When it comes to our values, we believe in the spirit of innovation.
When we face a problem, we think in terms of inventing a device to handle the problem for us. When we face an existential threat, we do not just face the threat head on. We approach the situation with cleverness. World War 2? We invent a device with horrific destructive capacity.

We face existential threats and if you buy into the logic outlined in this book, then you likewise believe that peace is a prerequisite to avoiding mass peril.

If you are a fellow American, I implore you to take the piece computer invention project seriously. I believe we are well suited to help charge ahead with this effort.

And fundamentally, we introduced the most horrific technology to our species. Because of us, Humans currently face a real possibility of global nuclear holocaust. Because of us, countless civilians experienced the unthinkable terror of two moments, Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We have a debt to pay.</Text>

It has been several microennia since the advent of the Piece Computer Era. We decided to stop creating eras. This is Era X. Era X is the end of the time machine for peace social invention program. Anything remaining that contributes to the time machine for peace vehicle resides in Era X.

We still don't understand dark matter and energy, as when we shed new light on some, even darker matter and energy emerges. We believe the darkness is a direct glimpse into the extra-universal space our universe is embedded in. Perhaps there is light beyond, too, not just darkness. If there is 'light' like we know beyond, our universe appears to reside within an enclosed vessel.

A few million years also provided a lot of new cosmological data. As time went on, and we fit theory to new data, we discovered that the projections of our physics into the beginning and end of time changed. There is still the very real prospect of a heat death of the universe, and we still see a singularity at the big bang, but the evolution leading toward and from those singular extremes looks much different than it did 7.7 million years ago in at the advent of the Piece Computer Era. We now suspect we may be physically stationary in the present, and linear time is the product of extrapolation, where the arrow of time is simply an artifact of the fact that our Human organisms developed with eyes on the front of their bodies, and not the rear. This evidence strongly suggests that the laws of physics--not just the proportionality constants--might actually evolve as time goes on. Time is still a problem because we have not solved mortality, but it may be that time never ends. Complexification may be an eternal process.

The universal piece process may also be just that, a universal phenomenon. Interestingly, the universal piece computer of Humanity spans many many galaxies, and a great deal of information flows between these galaxies because of this fact. Well, 'great deal' is a bit of a misnomer. The amount of information that passes between galaxies within the universal piece computer is downright stupendous. From a very literal perspective, the universal piece process is in fact, becoming a universal entity. The more we study the universal piece, the peace process, the more of the surrounding universe we see in ourselves.

Probably the largest recent discovery within the past million years was that the incomprehensible beyond may be trying to communicate directly with our universe. Some Humans speculate that the beyond may be speaking directly to us. Long story short, the intergalactic filament structures were telling, and the neuronal-like composition of galaxies and intergalactic matter, likewise telling. We now have string evidence to conclude that the universe is a living cellular organism, probably one of many, but now just a blob in its early stages of differentiating cell growth. We believe we might be in a dark space sheltered from the outside world that contains what we would think of as a brain. This brain has something like 100 billion galactic neural units, which interestingly is roughly the same amount of stars in each galaxy, roughly the same amount of neurons in each Human brain, plus or minus a few tens of billions.

Assuming this because nearly apparent a priori, our organism that we named Blob lives in a place we call the Wilder-ness, which is a high dimensional space beyond our comprehension; everything is wilder there, by nature of its incomprehensibility. This organism's cells look to us more like worlds. Because of the high dimensionality of the Wilder-ness, Blob's non overlapping world cells can overlap and nest indefinitely within our dimensional space.

Blob at this point in its development acts as a universal computational pieace fractal, and by our current understanding, the universe never stops growing in complexity; the pieace fractal continuously works to maximize the number of cells--or worlds--with no end in sight to the complexification. Our universe thus, looks like a blob of pieces constantly arranging and rearranging, creating and destroying pieces to generate greater peace--whatever that is--ultimately satisfying the collective will of the timespace matter mindmachines like us that roam this space.

Thus now more than ever, we are close to having the tools and data to answer the big question. Why do Humans exist?

Well, in the context of the extrauniversal organisms we presume to host life such as ours, we don't know why they--the organisms beyond and Blob--exist, but we devise a next best answer in terms of our biology: the only way to express an answer in Human language is that our universe was conceived by similar mature universal organisms in a corner of the Wilder-ness that they call home.

By our best knowledge, Humanity is what happens when two--or many--universes bang it out.

As for physics and mathematics, despite the darkness that surrounds us, we now know that love is the dominant force of our universe. We wonder if love supersedes the boundaries of this universe. We hope love supersedes our universe. What else than love would lie beyond is incomprehensible beyond our current mathematical and physical knowledge of the incomprehensible. Frankly, we'd rather not think about it. Besides, we have practical matters to attend to so we try to stay focused on our work to invent eternity. We try to stay focused on constructing the time machine for peace.

Some believe that as we accumulate more and more worlds and complexity, that our now feeble Human lifeform will as a collective, assume the same level of conscious experience of the lifeforms that conceived this universe. That is, we may actually become the experience of our universe, or so far as we know, we already are. We may be in the infant stages of universal conscious development.

As the extends, we might well then someday meet a new universe, or several, and Humanity may inevitably bang it out too--a never-ending self-similar self-cyclic peace process of timespace exploration and procreation--evolution. If that's a valid idea, then that's some time from now, even if true. In the meantime, we mind our business and keep on assuming our universe will die in finite time. So we keep on growing and developing the time machine for peace social invention program. Unless we have concrete scientific evidence otherwise, we must assume that we are all going to die unless we do something about it.

We must survive time, our greatest adversary. After all, we must satisfy The Human Imperative. 
At this point in our evolution, we really have no other options. We are growing old.

            <Title>The Gamble</Title>
            <Text>This project may be appropriated at any time by non peaceful entities or groups, especially under the guise of pursuing different versions of peace. This is ok, and welcome. However, the big gamble is that implementing world piece computers will be much harder for the morally and technically uninitiated. In other words, the gamble is that people who do not hold these values--or they hold very few of them--will be relatively unsuccessful at influencing the universal piece computer as a whole. If any antitypical world piece computer is successful, then this means that by definition the computers have successfully integrated into the universal piece computer.

The role of the universal piece computer in a strict practical sense is to unify/arrange/integrate worlds in ever increasingly better ways. Having the universal piece computer as an intermediary will therefore be better than having a group of people who share antitypical values with no computer alone.</Text>

            <Text>1-7 Peace / Piece Computers

Before we broach section 2, although there are many motivations, let's take a moment to go over the primary motivation underpinning the contents.

We have established that for global peace to make sense, we must adopt peace as a process that we define as the universal piece. At the global scale -- even local and individual – the universal piece process involves a massive amount of data, variables, and information. In mathematics, the universal piece may be considered the iterative solution to what we call an 'optimization problem'. The specific optimization problem is to find the best way to arrange all the individual worlds, group worlds, and other worlds, such that good stuff is maximized and bad stuff is minimized. This is a very large number of objects, variables, and conditions to account for.

Solving optimization problems that have many variables quickly becomes impossible to so by hand due to the amount of work involved. However, to the delight of modern mathematics and engineering, we invented the classical electronic computer to perform all the heavy lifting for optimization problems. Ever since the advent of the electronic computer, we have been using them to solve complex mathematics and engineering problems, responsible for the marvels of technology as we know today. There are limits to classical electronic computers regarding optimization problem -- this is where quantum computer becomes relevant -- but for now we should skip talking quantum.

So we have a spectacularly epic optimization problem -- global peace. The universal piece is the singular process that iteratively solves global peace. So here we are. We have an optimization problem and we have a process to solve the problem. If only we had something that could help us run the process faster, with more data and capacity!

Thus it makes sense that if computers are good at processing data (using the Von Neumann load-store architecture), and if they are good at running programs to solve optimization problems, then if we want global peace to happen then we should probably invent a special purpose computer that runs the universal piece process nonstop. This special computer will be called 'the universal piece computer' from now on, and by definition there may only be one.

Due to the vast computational needs for such a large optimization problem, logic would suggest the compute power (hardware) should be distributed on a global scale and decentralized. What we would have as a basic shape for the universal piece computer would be a network of compute nodes -- or clusters -- spread out across the planet. In the world of classical computers we typically form large computers out of many smaller computers. Networking techniques that make the internet possible also make bonding computers into a single computer possible.

At this point we have painted a picture of a single special computer spread out across the planet. It runs a single process that solves a single optimization problem to calculate the best configuration of Human worlds in a given moment. Let's go ahead an use a new vocabulary term introduced in the last part. We shall refer to Human worlds as being 'world pieces', and these are the objects that the universal piecce computer generates optimized configurations for.

Because compute nodes for the universal piece computer will always be controlled by somebody, these individual nodes will exist within a world piece, which is Human world that contains the node. To actually implement the universal piece computer, it will make most sense to create nodes that are their own individual computers. Just like the universal piece computer as a whole, these smaller computers will help run universal piece by running just the portion of the universal piece that serves their own world. We shall call each one of these contributing computers a 'world piece computer'. Unlike the universal piecece computer, world piece computers are plural, but only one world piece computer may be controlled by a single world at any given time.

The universal piece running within a world piece computer is a little different than running globally as a whole on the universal piece computer. In a world, the process of creating, returning to, and maintaining good and pleasant times is still the (same) universal piece, but the specific objects that the universal piece is solving the optimization problem for are both other world pieces (those not controlled by this Human world) and for simple non world pieces on their own. Pieces within a world piece may be any significant thing within that world. If you have a rain jacket in your backpack and a storm falls, your world piece computer will recognize that your rain jacket piece should be reconfigured so to be positioned on your torso. This will get the operator back to the pleasant experience of 'warm and dry'.

That should do it for now. The universal piece computer is comprised of participating world piece computers all contributing to the singular process of the universal piece. Each world piece computer runs the universal piece for its own world's pieces. World pieces that do not participate in running the universal piece are still included in global peace configuration solutions. And gluing all this together? To unify all of the above we naturally fall back to the modern communications infrastructure brought to us in large part by the innovating forces of capitalism!

This ends Part 1. Now we make a deeper dive into more about how the universal piece computer works.</Text>

            <Title>3W</Title>
            <Text>This book is part of a new genre called epic realism, in this case a work centered about Humanity prioritizing peace first as a process, and only then a result.

Why-How-What

I am going to refer to a rule from the world of corporate and entrepreneurial acumen, this one articulated best by Simon Sinek: if you are trying to communicate something, start with why, then move on to how, and finish with what.

The book will expound on the following why-how-what, which is not just my personal perspective, but by market research is one likely held by at least 10% of our population.

First though, a twist. Mr. Sinek neglects some things in his treatment of the six 'W's (yes I consider how one of the 'W' interrogative correlatives). Before we can even speak of why-how-what, we must address the most important part: the stage and it's cast. Prioritizing the remaining 'W's, people come first.

Who:

Human kind.

Humanity. Us. Our ancestors. Our offspring, their offspring, etc. But mainly Us.

After recognizing our being, we must respect the fact that time is our most valuable resource.

When:

Always.

Our past, our present, our future, and continuously so.

That leave where.

Where:

Everywhere.

Anywhere with historic, present, or future significance to Humanity.

Ok here we are, 8 billion Humans, experiencing the irreversible passage of time, spread out across a tiny planet with a handful in space. We have a lot of history, we have a lot of baggage, we have a lot of hopes and dreams, and we all die. Why is this book a thing?

Why:

We need peace.

We, our offspring, our offspring's offspring, etc, face imminent existential threats. Our future selves need our support, but we can't even seem to take care of ourselves. The only way to gain traction toward solving our biggest problems is by making some standardized form of global peace our sole priority. Everything else must fall into place around this singular direction. If there is no standard for peace, there is no hope of unifying as a species, and our biggest problems demand our unification. On a positive note, unless you live in a bubble of privilege, this reality we live is poor. We can and should expect so much more from what life has to offer us. We know it can be better, and we are motivated to make it so.

How:

Change the way we think about time, and implement new rules that are biased toward treating peace as a process, for the purpose of harnessing Human Nature to power the improvement of our Human Condition.

We will use our experience, knowledge, and wisdom to install a new set of rules and biases in favor of Why, in the form of a methodical peace process. We will recognize the fact that Human Nature, irreducible individual experiences and qualities, the cyclic but irreversible nature of time, these are all constants that we must live with. But, we will do as Humans do best and exploit these constants to harness their individual potentials for the purpose of doing useful work. We will harness the power of human nature to motivate action, where positive action receives positive incentives, and negative action generates negative incentives. We will harness the diverse difference potentials between individual circumstance to deliberately power the action of our Human Nature. We will teach ourselves to become better bookkeepers of time, recognizing that all time is not equal, and the time we do have impacts every facet of our being. Because we recognize our truest negative qualities as a species are unreliability and inconsistency, we will create a system that harnesses these constants, continuing to maintain these rules and biases in favor of Why, even when we sleep or die.

What:

Create a special computer that achieves the 'how' by running a peace process designed to optimize the arrangement of all the pieces and people in our worlds.

We will initiate a broad spectrum invention program revolving about the How. Each invention initiative introduces a new framework for improving the quality of our standardized global peace. The first initiative is to create a economic, political, and social technology to manage all the pieces--all the information, all the objects, ideas, people, worlds, etc. The first initiative is to invent the universal piece computer, a network of world piece computers, all running a singular peace process called the universal piece. The universal piece is the manifestation of global peace itself. Our global peace, simply, becomes the sum of all individual inner peace.

Let's begin.

            <Text>2-1 Computer Riff

The main course (this part) is all about computers. Before we can talk in depth about the universal piece computer and world piece computers, we set things up by riffing on computers as we know them today. In subsequent sections we will work in reverse spanning from the simple 'world piece', working out way up to the complexities of the universal piece computer. Concluding all this will be several sections on how to apply the learnings in this part.

So, these days when people hear the noun 'computer' they almost all think only of an electronic slab of silicon, a glowing colorful window to look inside, a board with lots of little keys to select symbols from, and maybe a little thing shaped like a mouse to point at stuff. Inside the computer you know are programs, some of them the computer uses for its own things, and some of them are applications for you to use. Sometimes the computer is big and needs a desk to live on, sometimes it is smaller and needs a lap to live on, and sometimes it is tiny and needs a pocket to live in. Finally, for various reasons we can get into maybe later, a large number of people sincerely dislike everything about computers.

That's the modern computer. This kind of computer I will from hereon refer to as an 'electronic computer in the Von Neumann load-store architecture', 'electronic computer', or ‘classical computer’ for short.

There are some of us who are more in the know. We are the ones who hear 'computer' and think 'device that manipulates signals and symbols'. Without stretching too much at first, we can immediately extend the notion of electronic computer beyond consumer versions. This may be up in scale such as massive high throughput supercomputers that fill entire buildings, or it may be down in scale such as embedded computers small enough to fit need tweezers to handle. All these electronic computers are digital meaning the symbols they manipulate are binary '1' and '0', and they use sampling to convert between analog signals and digital bits. For these computers, 

Speaking of analog, a more obscure (older mainly) form of electronic computer is the analog computer. For these computers, the signal they manipulate is the input which is modified intact to model and control systems (in most part). The symbols that analog computers manipulate are literally the symbolic quantities of math equations. Unlike a digital electronic computer that usually has a keyboard, an analog computer only has the signal input. The programming then, is the circuit and passive electrical components themselves that are 'plugged in' by different ways and the input signal travels through. The result is a computer that can solve systems of differential equations, integrate terms, and even perform automatic controls for dynamic systems (for those in the know).

Still though computers are not some new concept.  The idea to create a machine, then program it to take inputs, process symbols, then generate outputs accordingly, it's really quite old.

The very first electronic computers were arguably more mechanical than electronic. During world war one, Alan Turing and their team created an electro-mechanical computer made out of servos and gears to perform the intensive calculations needed to break the Nazi Enigma encryption codes, thus giving Allied powers an upper hand with intelligence in the war. This computer was digital.

Meanwhile, at Los Alamos, physicists were furiously working on the nuclear bomb, a certain force multiplier for whichever side won the creation (destruction) race. These physicists used analog computers to run the mathematical simulations they needed to produce a viable design. Instead of having to create many slightly different versions of the atomic bomb and test them all to see which works best (impossible actually, due to cost of plutonium) they were able to simulate designs first, and only then test the design with the best simulation results.

In both cases, primitive electronic computers saved on resources that simply were not available at the time. Alan Turing probably could have accomplished the same results by recruiting an army of 10,000 people to run calculations by hand (though in parallel), but those people would be impossible to recruit and synchronize effectively.
Likewise, the scientists at Los Alamos saved countless time and avoided the not-enough-plutonium show-stopper. These cases marked the modern age of computation, and since then, any time somebody bumps into an intractable problem in engineering, mathematics, or science, a new computer is born.

Electronic computers work overall because with electricity we can do things with waves and wiggle or switch stuff fast.

The digital computer generally takes time from the input to output to perform all the binary arithmetic needed to manipulate symbols by storing as bits in memory first (buffers), loading those bit into a device that flips and shifts those bits on and off really fast, then outputs the result by storing into memory again. This process goes by as fast as we can turn bits on and off, and takes as long as it takes to do all the loading, flipping, and storing for the input operation. This means there is a delay (or latency) for anything done with a digital computer. Fortunately, we can turn bits on and off absurdly fast now (billions of times per second) for to us the delay is negligible. 

The analog computer on the other hand works by doing stuff with waves instead of bits, by exploiting a general mathematical property called linearity. These computers take an input in form of a complex wave signal (the decomposition into sine and cosine terms are the symbols) and modifies the input wave signal producing an output in real time. (Actually, as these are lump-parameter systems, the speed of electromagnetic light is negligible, thus the processing delay in an analog computer is approximately the speed in a coaxial cable which is ~2/3 the speed of light in a vacuum.) When solving systems of equations, sometimes it takes time for the solution to 'settle', but in general the analog computer produces output instantaneously.

So electronics give us speed and volume when it comes to manipulating signals and symbols computationally.

Before electricity there were still computers, but they were strictly mechanical, non electronic. These computers still gave their users an advantage in time (and accuracy). Decades before electronics, there was a mon named Charles Babbage, and a woman named Ada Lovelace. Over the course of years, Babbage invented what was called the difference engine, a programmable machine that did general arithmetic. Ada Lovelace in concert with Babbage wrote programs that told the difference engine how to operate and propagate inputs. (The difference engine took numbers on cogs as inputs, cards with holes as programs, and output numbers on cogs.) In this case, the symbols are the arithmetic operators, and the decimal numbers. Unfortunately for them, the cost of hardware and gears was too much and disincentivized investment and adoption. Nonetheless, this was the last mechanical non electronic computer before the electronic age.

Even earlier, a non electronic computer was invented by a textile merchant named Joseph-Marie Jacquard. This computer was a programmable attachment to standard looms at the time. To use the computer, a weaver would insert a card with punched holes indicating instructions, and the loom would automatically weave the pattern. Yet again, this non electronic computer allowed textile manufacturers to produce patterned textiles between 10x and 50x faster than the traditional loom alone (and with fewer errors). This computer's inputs were thread stock, and the output an intricate pattern woven into fabric. The signals were the various tensions and positions of the apparatus in a moment, and the symbols were the punch-hole encodings of desired patterns. This was such a big deal at the time that Jacquard became filthy rich because of it.

Finally, it won't hurt to travel back to ancient times. The Romans and Greeks had a way with innovation. These examples I still consider computers, but this position is much more debatable from a modern perspective:

Another example of a mechanical computer was the steam powered player organ (persisting to this day, also as a player piano). The player organ  took in steam to power the pipes, and minimal control (pedal stuff) from a user. To run the computer, a program in the form of a tape with holes punched in it was fed into it. The output was a nice song and the symbols manipulated were the musical notes played. For the Romans, it was a lot easier and cleaner to ditch the musicians and have a slave run the player organ. The benefit was perfection and consistent attendance. In any case, the player organ is similar to a music box, but the little nubs that play the song are programmable (and holes, actually).

Finally, we have to talk about the Greeks. The Greeks were responsible for creating the oldest analog computer that we know of. This is now called the Antikythera Mechanism, found in a shipwreck and recently digitally reconstructed. This computer was a mechanical contraption of gears and dials that took an input in the form of celestial body positions, producing an output predicting the future positions of those bodies (our solar system and key stars). The symbols in this example were orbits and positions.

There are certainly many more examples that I am unaware of, but the point should be clear: in a general sense (not in the modern 'electronic computer' sense) computers have been around for a very long time.

~

An important trend emerged in the 20th century regarding the evolution of computers. Computers always seem to start with special purpose, then move to a general purpose form once the special purpose form has demonstrated that it can solve the hardest problems. This observation was pointed out by Richard Hamming of Bell Laboratories. What this means for us is that our daily-use general electronic computers with Word and Outlook and minesweeper only came to be due to much more difficult problems serving as the 'test subjects' for the electronic computer.

In the context of this computer project, this means that world piece computers will be difficult to use, before they get easy. Adoption will not catch on until we can demonstrate that world piece computers work for the most difficult cases. This theme will pop up here and there when we go over examples.

The term 'general' must be addressed. Experts tend to call the modern electronic computer a 'general computer'. What this means is that the computer is fully programmable, and reprogrammable. Every aspect (nearly) of the computer's internal functionality is controlled by a plethora of different programmed software. We call some of these 'firmware', 'kernel', 'operating system', 'application'. (Firmware is the software that tells the hardware how to do its dirty work, and the kernel is software that let's us talk to the hardware from our operating system and applications.) With some exception to firmware, a general computer is special because every aspect of it's operation reprogrammable (assuming you know what you are doing, and also assuming you have the right permissions to reprogram). We can say that a general computer is 'software defined', and this exemplified by things like 'virtual computers (within a computer)' and 'cloud computing [?]'.

Finally, there are many computer architectures. Outlined previously, many are analog or mechanical even. In the case of the general computer, we have what is called a load-store machine. This means that there is an input/output, there is a memory, and there is a processor that loads words from memory, performs bitwise operations on those words, then stores the result back in memory. This is known as the Von Neumann architecture and it can only process one thing at a time (though there are ways to hack this).

Another computer architecture that is gaining importance is the quantum computer, which compared to digital electronic computers is remarkably similar to classic analog electronic computers, and their modern digital counterparts. For one, a quantum computer manipulates symbols called state variables instead of binary bits (although they still tend to make these state variables binary, giving them the name qubits). Instead of loading bits into a processor and flipping them one at a time, we instead assemble a system of variables that each represent something unique about the system. By quantum magic (system isolation in spacetime) this system becomes a superposition of all possible states -- combinations -- of those variables. Superposition means that every possible way that the system could be found (the states) exists at the same time, like actually, physically.

Because of super position, the first benefit of quantum computers is that we can handle more information at one time. [need to figure out the bits vs state variables capacity difference again] 
[come back to this]

The next benefit is that quantum computers can generate a solution instantaneously, much like analog computers. [need to go deeper on this too]

The reason I bring up quantum computers is that like I said earlier, these computers are good at solving large systems of equations. (Reminder, in algebra the word 'solve a system' means to find the values for all unknowns such that all the equations work plugging in those values.) By the fundamental theorem of algebra, systems of equations (at least well formulated ones) have one equation per unknown that needs to be solved. In each equation, there is also one term for each unknown. If we need to use a Von Neumann architecture to solve a large system of equations, then we essentially will need to approach the solution by checking things one-by-one (for the most part, brute force at least). For large systems the number of things to check is so large that it just takes too long to brute force a solution, even with computers operating at billions of cycles per second.

Again as mentioned in Part 1, one of the most common motivations for solving a system of equations is that we use these systems to solve optimization problems. In crude terms, an optimization problem is when we take a list of unknowns and ask, "what are the unknown values that give me the most or the least of some outcome?" If we were talking about a factory, an optimization problem could be, "given all my input materials, their quantity and their cost, what is the perfect combination of the different widgets I make that will maximize my profits?" Optimizations are actually very difficult problems, so much so that we have been relying on computers to help out for decades now.

So if talking about global peace, we are easily talking about more unknown quantities than we have time to count aloud. The only viable option for solving optimization problems so large will be to rely on quantum computation. This is why there is so much interest in being first to market with quantum computers. As electronic computers are practical for personal day-to-day work, quantum computers will probably be much less so for that. Instead, quantum computers will operate in hubs where data happens to converge, or isolated facilities dedicated to solving hard computational problems. Maybe I'll have one in my living room to optimize my stuff, for fun (or profit?)

The computer architecture capable of running the universal piece is neither an electronic computer -- analog or digital -- nor is it a quantum computer. However, this does not mean that the piece-based computer architecture will not make heavy uses of the two preexisting architectures. As it happens, the universal piece architecture takes computer generality to an extreme, which will talk about in depth in the next section.</Text>

            <Title>the great pumpkin incident</Title>
            <Text>1578 PCE

At this point, Humanity has been thinking explicitly in terms of time and peace for roughly 1500 years. Oddly enough, there exist way more tents than anybody 1500 years ago could have imagined. Tents everywhere. Tents within tents. Tent cities. Tent homes. Not really any tent vehicles (anymore at least) as teleportation recently became a viable mode of short-range transportation in the past 200 years. (The exception being starships, as some too are tents.) Oddly enough, teleportation emerged at exactly the same time as the great tent revolution. Historians argue about why this is, but to be honest, not many people care. Over time, this came to be known as the Great Tent Revolution. The Great Tent Revolution was caused by what to date is the greatest Human technological accomplishment. The advent of these tents changed the entire outlook of our species.

The exotic tent technology was a discovery, an accident--now referred to as the great pumpkin incident--not an invention (though many believe we should have prioritized an invention program to realize such a technology sooner).

The two people who discovered this technology were part of a materials research and development program, tinkering with advanced tent materials about 200 years ago, presumably applying learnings to space technology of some sort. One day, a particular type of nanowoven bilayer fabric was erected as a fully enclosed tent. This was for the purpose of studying its ability to protect some plant life (pumpkin seedlings) from exterior elements. Apparently plasma was involved, so naturally there was a ton of exotic scientific and radio-frequency equipment strewn about the lab. It was pretty crowded in there for the two scientists.

That particular day the two lab partners were working together on the tent. It was this whole situation. The pumpkin seeds were planted and sealed inside the tent, just seeds and some hydroponic equipment. All the equipment was powered on and ready to engage the experiment, but with such close quarters and all the brushing and bumping these two scientists couldn't really contain things any longer. It was time to do some urgent unplanned research; it really was an unsafe situation with all that equipment around.

Suffice to say, when the two were finally satisfied with each other's scientific results, roughly ten minutes later, some equipment had been jostled and bumped around. During that time, one piece of equipment was actually knocked entirely over by some brief side-experiments being performed, crashing to the ground against the tent; the tent was consequently subjected to a particular phase modulated electrostatic driver, with some random parameters because the buttons and knobs were all mashed up.

As it happened, the two were up late the night before (drinking and presumably doing more vigorous research) so the one who sealed up the tent was a little foggy and couldn't remember if they turned on the hydroponic system. When they opened up the tent to check; the hydroponic system was indeed turned on. The unexpected result of their spontaneous fit of vigorous research however, was that inside the tent there now lay a royal mess of rotting pumpkins. 

The two scientists ultimately shared a Nobel Prize. Humanity had officially freed up time. 

In what seemed like overnight, everything changed. Trivial conflict basically evaporated. One of the first things people did was catch up on sleep. Fear Of Missing Out due to sleep was no longer a detractor from inner peace. People also found time to work out their trivial (but erosive) disagreements.

A few mega timetents were erected after not long, large enough to nest up to three tents. These turned into 

~

We call them timetents now. These are conductive nanowoven bilayer fabric enclosures than when sealed and subjected to the a resonant phase modulated electrostatic driver, and at just the right points on the tent structure, the rate of entropic increase in the tent rises to a point specified as the time compression ratio. For Humans in a timetent this ratio is up to about 1:10, one second outside per 10 seconds inside. Plant matter for agriculture is much simpler than Hominoid forms, so plants like wheat can experience time compression ratios of up to 1:100.

Popular demand quickly sought after compression ratios greater than 1:10 for Humans, so the next step was to create timetents within timetents. A timetent required the power output of a lab grade fusion reactor though, so the timetents that housed smaller timetents needed to be large enough to fit an entire fusion reactor in (rather large in most cases). Timetent design and nesting was therefore dependent on the progress of fusion reactor miniaturization. At the current time being, the maximum nest is two. Humans can achieve a compression rate of 1:100, plants, around 1:1000. One current engineering goal of the time machine for peace is to achieve triple nesting within the next 100 years.

1500 years ago, most people would get thinking about time travel, drumming up fantastic ideas of machines that took one into the past, the future, whenever. Sadly for them, most of their ideas were just that: fantasies. Near the beginning of the Piece Computer Era, mathematical physicists provided the first formal proof that demonstrated time travel into the past is in fact impossible by our current understanding of physical reality. We still don't know if time travel to the future in the non-trivial sense is possible. Trivial future travel is commonplace these days, but only for relatively short intervals. This includes cryogenesis, and high velocity space travel that exploits the time dilation of special relativity. Currently time engineers are developing schemes that cryogenically freeze people in starships orbiting the sun at high velocity for future archival and diplomatic purposes. Some people think this is foolish, cosmic rays and all. Whatever; Humans will do their thing.

So these days, people don't time travel; these days, people timestay. Timestay wouldn't be possible without fusion reactors, because timetents require a ton of energy to speed everything up in the enclosure. Before timestay technology, modern physics knew only of time dilation (time slowing down) to be a physical phenomenon. Now though, time compression (time speeding up) was the focus of interest. Nowadays an entire engineering discipline is dedicated to optimizing timetent compression ratio efficiencies. Time accounting is likewise a burgeoning industry, for with all this extra timef





One consequence of the Great Tent Revolution is that significant strides have been made in life extension technology. This is good, if

            <Text>The purpose of this sub-piece is to set the stage, in a grand sense.

There exist two primary forms of physical simplicity. One type, it defines our past--the other, our future. These terms however are strictly relative to the present. As it turns out, we happen to live in this awkward space somewhere in between.

Our notion of this physical simplicity in the past originated at a moment we refer to as the big bang. The big bang is a type of singularity. At this singularity, all the stuff we know and love was all bunched into a point, undifferentiated. Beyond this point--beyond the beginning of linear time--our modern physics breaks down entirely.

Our notion of this physical simplicity in the future is more of an extremely well informed prediction for a similar point in linear time. (This means that instead of a preponderance of evidence that something happened, we have a preponderance of evidence that something will happen.) At this singular point in the future however, all stuff isn't perfectly packed into a point. Instead, all stuff is perfectly spread out, a singular smear. This moment marks the end of linear time, and we refer to this moment as the heat death of the universe. Beyond this point--the end of linear time--our physics has nothing left to say. (Physicists chose this name because at this moment our physics says it will be impossible for anything new and interesting to happen.)

When I say linear time, I mean something very specific. I am referring to the fourth dimension of Einstein's general relativity (which is so far accepted as the best proven description of the physical reality at a cosmological scale). This fourth dimension of time is effectively equivalent to any one of the three spatial dimensions we are all familiar with, being up-down, left-right, forward-backward. This fourth dimension is exactly what you generally think of when you think time passes.

The reason I say it is effectively equivalent to space is that time in general relativity (and the original classical physics' sense) differs qualitatively from regular space in one massive way: time has the quality of something we call the arrow of time. The name arrow of time should evoke exactly what it sounds like, that time as we know it is uni-directional. I use uni-directional to mean that time is irreversible.

(And for you physicist firing back with your nigh impossible edge case hypotheticals, may I remind you, this treatment refers to what we have a preponderance of evidence for. Just because reversibility is theoretically possible with some incomprehensibly small likelihood, does not mean reversibility should be declared possible for the sake of this conversation.)

Time is irreversible, and the catch? We have zero agreed-on clue as to why this is. This is one of the two great mysteries of modern Humans' understanding of physical reality (the other being to explain why subjective experience feels the way it feels, or the hard problem of consciousness). We know that stuff in the past is less spread out than stuff in the future. The big bang is a moment where everything is condensed into a point, and the heat death of the universe is a moment where everything is spread out into a smear. When you pop a balloon, the helium molecules immediately spread out in a way that cannot be reversed thus, one cannot un-pop a balloon. Time = start in that example is the moment the balloon is popped, and time = future is when those balloon molecules keep spreading out more and more. Even the rubber of the balloon will disintegrate as time passes, and the constituent molecules will spread out as time goes on.

As it turns out, what I have described above about the arrow of time is formally expressed by what we call the second law of thermodynamics. The second law of thermodynamics is a mathematical expression of the arrow of time that the entropy of the universe increases as time goes on. (Entropy is basically a concept from physics that lets us measure how spread out stuff is. Low entropy means stuff is more condensed, and high entropy means stuff is more spread out. Your bedroom when its clean is in a state of low entropy relative to when your bedroom is a total mess, which is a state of higher entropy.) I introduce the term entropy and thermodynamics to emphasize to you that the second law of thermodynamics is perhaps the best-verified law of modern physics to date.

This paragraphs above is to set the stage for the point: to restate, we Humans exist in a place in between the big band and the heat death of the universe. Now we introduce a paradox: despite the unavoidable tendency for stuff to spread out (and die) as time goes on, we look at life forms like ourselves and those that surround us and we realize that they all temporarily violate the second law of thermodynamics. If we look at Humanity as a whole--as a species--we appear to be growing into a larger, singular whole. Within the scope of our existence as a life form, something keeps increasing within the Human universe, and this is not entropy.

Complexity is the essence of this increasing quantity. As long as we have the resources at our disposal (and as long as we don't decimate our edifice with nuclear holocaust, as long as we survive global warming, etc), we continuously increase in complexity. The more our society, technology, culture, institutions, etc, complexifies, the more we realize that the rate seems to have no apparent upper bound. (It could very well be that the rate is a function of population size and interconnectivity, in a combinatorial sense.)

Along these lines, it also seems that complexity is related to consciousness. Consciousness seems to emerge as a product of living organisms complexifying enough to develop brain. As we Humanity continues to complexify, we are beginning to notice the emergence of higher levels of collective awareness. We look at our global information exchange networks, and people themselves take on an almost neuronal quality. On this same note, but much much darker, the more we complexify and the more aware we become, the more problems (and more intense they are) that we seem to face. This begs a question:

Why do problems exist? The deepest response to this question (while still remaining grounded in the world of scientific reason) is that people exist. (To be more accurate, living organisms with brains exist.) Take a closer look at this statement in the context of above. Clearly the motion, formation, destruction of celestial bodies on the cosmic scale is not a problem. This is just the natural evolution of stuff. Besides, planets devoid of life do not have brains present.

One this we know for certain about brains is that they give the owners the ability to exercise free won't, the ability to exercise restraint, the extent of which depending on the complexity of the brain. (Free won't is the appropriate phrase simply because if all a conscious organism does is what it wants, then this is no different than reflex, instinct. It is generally agreed that consciousness is something that free agents possess.) For different organisms with less developed brains (well, Humans too), free won't is generally mediated by fear. Ultimately this harks back to the evolutionary principle that organisms with brains that make the best moves are the organisms that survive well enough procreate. (Naturally, there are pathological cases of this however.)

There are a lot a big assumptions and statements packed into the last two paragraphs. For our purposes it doesn't really matter how valid they are. This piece is to tell one possible version of a story.

Point is, if people didn't exist, if brains didn't exist, if higher consciousness didn't exist, then problems as Humans understand the word would not exist.

People are the problem. People have the brains. Technology isn't the problem, because it doesn't have brains. Resource scarcity isn't the problem, because resources are not free agents with brain. You will be hard pressed to identify a Human problem that does not ultimately trace back to decisions made by Human brains.

So we set the stage for a discussion about resource scarcity. If we didn't exist, we wouldn't have problems. But self-extinction is not an option. (It might be for the chronically depressed or the wealthy elite, but not the rest of us.)

It's pretty easy to argue that time is the most scarce of the resource trifecta: people, time, and energy.

All the other resource scarcities exist because the wheels of capitalism place profit and stuff on a pedestal; we have a marketplace--an exchange--where we trade our scarce time for money, which we use to survive; we have a ruling class of wealthy elite incentivized by profit to keep things as they are; we have a people who at the most can buy stuff with their money, often without the time to use; we have a people who demand stuff at lower and lower price, because like time, money becomes scarce, too; we have an obsession with plastic, automobiles, electricity, in other words, fossil fuels.

You and I don't have a time machine, so we have no choice about capitalism becoming as it is. We have choice moving forward, but we have to assume that something about the emergent nature of capitalism provided something we need, say, like the development of a technological foundation that provides the electricity, medicine, transportation, agriculture, information exchange network, etc, that we demand of society. If I were to suggest that I could undo capitalism but we had to give up electricity, medicine, transportation, agriculture, networking technology, etc, this simply would not be entertained by nearly all of us. If you suggest, 'go ahead, I'll just live off the land', you are failing to realize that the bare land alone is incapable of sustaining our current world population, and you would be sentencing--probably the majority--of fellow Humans to an extremely unpleasant demise. Don't be evil.

Ok, so say we focus only on what we can do in the future to peacefully introduce a new form of economy, one more sustainable and Humane--say we stop obsessing over the past which we cannot change. Ok, so let's evolve our ways.

The problem is scarcity of time, not our resolve; we have the resolve we need. Time scarcity boils down into three aspects: absolute, people, and energy.

Working backward, say we all find the time to evolve our ways, we quickly find that the big problem is coordinating energy, or different kinds of time. When I have the time, you have the time, and we are together, one or both of us might not have any energy. I may have the energy to work on our evolution with creativity and vigor, but you may be too tired from your long day at work and the issues at home you have been trying to resolve. In this case, I need you for the project we are working on, but you don't have the energy to help like you need. You are experiencing energy scarcity. Or, perhaps we both have the raw energy, but our energies are of different type. I may have darker angry aggressive energy, while you have lighter creative energy. We have plenty of energy, but our energies are incompatible so we likely will not get much done.

From the other direction, when we have compatible energy, we may be inaccessible to one another. I may be feeling creative and I may need your input in the moment, but you are asleep and unreachable. I may find that this case of people scarcity impedes my ability to get anything done. Or, on a deeper plane, I may need to draw from the wisdom of somebody in my family who has passed away. Such person is permanently scarce, and I may be limited by their ability to leave behind record of their legacy, beliefs, knowledge, wisdom. Less deep, I may need the expertise of somebody that I do not know, or do not know even exists. I am limited by the scarcity of somebody I know not that I need.

Both these scarcities are not limited to matching types, rather they are limited in the negative sense. I may be feeling light and creative, but I actually need some destructive energy to whittle down my creative work. If all I get is light and creative, then I never get the chance to really refine my work. Likewise with people, I may think I need somebody scarce to get things done, but really I would be better off if that scarce person were not present.

Energy scarcity and people scarcity relate to time in that eliminating these scarcities depends on our ability to coordinate the different kinds of time that these scarcities represent. If we think of defining our time in terms of separate dimensions representing the energies and people that define moments, then the problem to solve is to find the best way to match these different times with each other. This means coordinating people among those four dimensions of general relativity--time and 3d space.

Now say hypothetically we find a way to perfectly coordinate our scarce energies and people. Even then we still have the most important scarcity, that being absolute time scarcity. Even when everything is just right, we just don't have enough time! This is because there is only so much time in a day, and because we are incentivized to sell our time in the labor market, usually for labor that has nothing to do with our resolve to evolve our social/economic/political institutions and improve our Human Condition. To put this obviously, we never have enough time when we need it. (You might have the inclination to point out that three dimensional space is an equally scarce resource as time. This is not so, mainly due to the fact we have the technological ability to coordinate time among people who are geographically distributed. Also, besides capacity, sharing a single space is limited by how much time we have to take turns.)

Without the time, we have not the ability to effectively and efficiently coordinate ways to educate, innovate, and overcome the scarcities of other--more mundane--resources such as fossil fuels, minerals, water, money, etc. If we insist that self-extinction is not an option, then we must accept the fact that all of our problems revolve around time. Time is the problem.

Time.

What would a practical, general solution to this fact look like (as constrained above)? I argue it would look like this:

In a perfect world (but grounded in reality), we would find a technological and social system capable of optimizing the timing and unification of our different energies and people. We would find that such a system was made possible by creating a special purpose language, physics, mathematics devoted to recognizing time as multidimensional, dimensions including energy types and people. We would find that in general we tend to think explicitly in terms of time, energy, and people scarcity.

By the thesis from the education | language | consilience essay &lt;&lt;insert location here&gt;&gt;, by the Sapir-Wharf hypothesis such a time management system would work primarily because the language we use revolves around time, and this would change the way we think (and maybe even rewire our individuals brains, appealing to neuroplasticity and the strong form of the Sapir-Wharf hypothesis). Further, on a collective level, a physics and mathematics  revolving around time would change the way we see technology and innovate as a species.

This book is about what such a system or machine would look like. Due to the immensity of such a creative endeavor, it would involve some form of a computer, a tool to help us manage the massive creative effort. There will be a multitude of pieces involved, worlds too. Speaking descriptively, this effort would involve world piece computers, in a way that forms a network. We could define the overall activity--the process--as the universal piece computer, due to the fact that all worlds are different and the network's glue would be something universally common. This glue I argue, is to treat peace as a computational process.

If time is the root of all our problems, and our problems distress us (as they should), then peace is the common concept that we can all relate to wanting, be you peacelike or warlike. Peace as a process is fitting, because process implies change or movement, which is the basis of time.

It would serve us to name the time management system outlined above. This is the time machine for peace, a system or machine (social, technological, economic, political, ...) that deliberately, methodically--effectively--empowers us to get to the best future we can imagine. The first component of the time machine for peace is piece computer, applied to individual worlds as world piece computers and applied to the sum of our worlds as a whole, being the universal piece computer.

Let's invent the piece computer. And ideally, let's make it a good time.

            <Text>* correct 'subjective time cycles' to 'subjective time loops'
* 'time loop' to timeloop

The emphasis of physics these days to create a new branch of the discipline, but to explain the subjective reality around us, quickly brought us to the realization that time is more fundamental than any of the spatial dimensions. The four dimensions of spacetime from classical objective physics are all considered spatial dimensions, even the dimension of time. (Although time is a privileged spatial dimension because from our perspective we cannot reverse time.)

Timespace is what you get when you think of spacetime strictly in terms of cycles. In the 19th century JCE, a Human by the name of Joseph Fourier invented what was probably the most profound devices in mathematics, even to this day. This was naturally chosen to be called the Fourier Transform (pronounced 4-E-A transform). The Fourier Transform allows us to think of the world in terms of cycles, or repetition.

The transform works like so: I can take any well-behaved function that describes an outcome in terms of some input, and I can transform that function into a collection of wiggles. There wiggles are cycles or repetitions, being what we call the frequency content of the function that describes the behavior of whatever I'm interested in.

A classic example of what I mean by this is the music heard by the ear from a song. A song is a collection of instruments and beats and notes, all blended together into a single sound wave. If you were to visualize what this wave looked like traveling through the air toward your ear, you would see only a single complicated waveform, or wiggle. You would not be able to tell by looking at this single waveform what instruments and notes are playing without listening to the waveform yourself. But, if I take that waveform and apply this mathematical Fourier transform to it, then the output will be the collection of all the individual frequencies playing. You could see distinct high frequency content that you could identify as a violin. You could see other frequencies that you could identify as bells, or singing. You would see low frequency that is the bass, or even lower, the slow beat of a drum. With knowledge of all these different frequencies from that single waveform, you can then pick an choose which you would like to study. You could erase the low frequency leaving only the violin and bells. You could make the low frequency bass stronger, or louder. You can even add frequencies. Then you can apply the inverse Fourier transform to smash everything back together into a single song, and listen to the changes.

This is a primary example of something called filtering. Filtering lets us take a complicated and singular world that surrounds us, and break it into manageable chunks. By applying a Fourier transform, we are effectively speaking the language of whatever it is we are breaking into chunks. This approach to making sense of our surroundings is so wildly successful, that without it, we would not have what we have today.

So timespace and spacetime. As it turned out, every single type of output from a function can be considered a quality. Interestingly, every single quality happens to be embedded within the fundamental spatial dimensions of spacetime. In other words, it is impossible to think objectively about a quality without it being tied somehow to spacetime. We call these correlates. For example, if you think about the difference between red and blue in your head, you might say that this is beyond the realm of spacetime. You would be wrong however, because by virtue of thinking about red and blue, you must switch between thinking about the two in a cycle of comparison. I can relate this to spacetime was watching the difference in brain activity through time and space. As long as I have information about which color you are thinking of in the moment--red, blue, or both--I can create a function that describes your comparison process in terms of spacetime. That is, even if it is just in your head, as long as I know what red looks like in this context, I can apply a Fourier transform to your brain activity to tell you at exactly what frequencies you tend to think about red.

The point is that the entire world of subjective qualities can map to the domain of cycles and repetitions via a Fourier transform. Call this domain timespace. It was called this to emphasize that cycles and repetitions are the tick-tocks of how stuff evolves. In timespace we can define the passage of time as 'change X per cycle Y'. This is much different than spacetime's time, where the passage of time is just 'stuff moves around'.

We can take all the little cycles and add them together to form chains and larger cycles. My quality of position in spacetime may in frequency domain look like I am pacing in a circle. However, taking these smaller qualities as a whole and looking over much larger and longer regions in spacetime, we might see that these pacing cycles are part of a much larger cycle called 'going to work each day'.

The interesting takehome here is that every cycle in timespace and the corresponding movement of stuff through spacetime, no matter how large or complex, is a qualitative signature. That is, an experience, and the feel of which depends on surrounding context, and whatever object is serving as the observer.

In my going to work cycle, there is this one chunk of broken concrete experiences this cycle too, because every time I seem to step on it just enough to trip me a little. Every time I step on it, this chunk feels my gravitational pull as I near it, and when close enough, it feels my atoms repel against it and push hard when I step. The concrete doesn't have a brain, so all it has is the simple context of the ground beneath is pushing back. Thus, each time I trip on this concrete, the chunk experiences deformation, every day at around the same time. Me however, I have a brain and a lifetime of experience imprinted on my neural network, so every time I find myself stepping on the chunk walking into the office, my experience is one of disappointment to be going to work, then irritation when I trip on the chunk. All of this is just a single cycle. If we were to think of such a cycle as a physical object, considering the duration of one cycle as a single moment, my body would look like a smear through spacetime. Variations in my cycle over the course of many cycles would look like a blurry smear.

From the field of plasma physics, we can describe a complex cycle in similar terms as what we call adiabatic invariance. Adiabatic invariance is just when the essence of an object's cycle changes very slowly for each go around. When a cycle evolves, we often speak in terms of the residue that it leaves behind, or the nature of the change. The residue is the fundamental unit of passing time in timespace, and we make sense of a cycle's motion in terms that are relative to other cycles. 

The reason any of this became important is because any world piece computer--and especially the universal piece computer--needs to have a clock to coordinate synchronization of our limited people, time, and energy. A piece computer needs a way to tick and tock to synchronize, and it needs a way to express what happens between each tick and tock.

Timespace provides the resolution needed to pull this off. The problem with the spacetime domain is that it only has one unit per dimension, four--which in our case is the second and the meter or foot. This means that we have one unit to express our most important commodity which is our objective time.

The great thing about timespace is that now we can have all the units we need, and one dimension per unit. Each dimension here is a cycle that corresponds to a subjective quality, and each dimension can be linked to the other dimensions that are relevant, relating to one another via a web of propagating residues.

To differentiate from objective time, we call this subjective time, mainly to highlight the fact that each timeloop has a corresponding quality. Ultimately we can take these cycles and relate them back to objective time, either by taking the inverse Fourier transform of each quality involved, or by counting objective time in terms of how long it takes a cycle to complete.

One of the primary tasks of the universal piece computer is to treat each world piece computer as its own lattice of linked subjective timeloops--all the day to day cycles and activities in a world--and link them together with a larger timeloop one level up.

We call the map of linked timeloops, a timepiece. The timepiece itself is a world piece computer's clock, ultimately linking up to the universal timepiece at the global level of the universal piece computer. We employ simple artificial intelligence bots that crawl the universal timepiece searching for new patterns within all the nooks and crannies of the subjective time loops in order to optimize the world synchronizations.

The universal piece (the global peace process) happens ride on top of the universal timepiece. Because the operations within the peace process must be aligned just right (in the same way bits need to be aligned in the modern electronic computer), and because the alternating tick tock of peace state updates and changes must align with other loops, the timepiece is a fundamental piece within every functioning world piece computer.

Ultimately, the scope of interest reaches peace as the product, be this at the core with state of individual inner peace, or globally with the state of global peace. This is where we translate all subjective time loops back into objective time to take a measure of or a change to the peace state in a given moment. The passage of inner peace or global peace states from moment to moment is what we call peace time.

Timespace is interesting because the timeloops themselves are the singular objects. In other  words, timeloops are points in timespace. To differentiate between spacetime objects, we choose to call timeloops bodies. Even spacetime objects that are not moving has a trivial timeloop, which is just the body with a timespace smear equal its object. Even trivial timeloops have a corresponding quality, which is simply the quality of the object being at a stationary position. We believe there is probably a fundamental comparison rate that may set the 'common time' for all comparison operations within timespace.

These days, we call bodies in timespace pieces. Every piece has a corresponding spacetime object, it has a quality, and it has an image.

In objective physics, objects are made up of particles that cannot overlap, and they interact by exchanging force via different particles called light that can overlap. These are called Fermions for objects, and bosons for light or image. All the motion of objects can be explained in terms of the shape of spacetime and the light that bounces around filling all space. Each object in spacetime likewise has an experience that is defined as the image it 'sees' from the light generated by other interacting objects. In almost all cases, these light particles are called photons.

In subjective physics, bodies are likewise made out of particles that cannot overlap. These particles are pieces. For each piece, or timeloop, one and only one may exist. If a second piece of the same quality exists, then it is occupying a different point in timespace, with the difference generally being the quality of 'different place' in spacetime. (For example, one person thinking 'apple' in spacetime cannot correspond to two apple timeloop bodies in timespace. However, two people thinking 'apple' will have two identical timeloop bodies, besides the quality of both people occupying different space.)

The 'light' of timespace acts the same way as light in spacetime. Pieces are constantly exchanging what we call qualitons, or the analogue to photons. Depending on the composition two pieces and their position in timespace, pieces exchange qualitons for which any number possible can overlap. Although the mechanisms are poorly understood at the moment, qualitons appear to mediate piece behavior, just like photons mediate the electromagnetic force.

(There are also the strong and weak nuclear forces of spacetime with their own Fermions and Bosons. These forces likewise have analogs in timespace, but that is beyond the scope of this piece.)

At this point it is crucial to note that spacetime is a fundamental object, but it is not the fundamental space. However, every piece in timespace is believed to contain as one of its constituent qualities, an object in spacetime. We do not definitely know if it is possible to have an isolated piece with no object. Many people now believe in Platonic forms, which is exactly such expression, where concepts such as 'triangle' or 'circle' exist in pure form without a correlating spacetime object.

This distinction is important because it appears that the passage of subjective time in timespace is directional, and probably for the same reason that spacetime objective time is directional. It seems that pieces in timespace are either falling through timespace with a velocity, or they are still and timespace is flowing around like a headwind. Not that this matters, but it might. As pieces interact with each other, they struggle to stay oriented properly with the wind of time, facing forward with their spacetime objects, and they accumulate and copy pieces as time goes on becoming larger and larger with more and more experience, or qualiton capture. This is important because it appears that Human individuals are the tallest of these growing mountainous bodies, and all the extra qualitons they emit both deliberately and reflexively appear to be the causal mediators of all non trivial transformation.

As per the actual intelligence essay, the reason this is important is that massive individual timespace bodies appear to gravitate toward one another according to both similarity and difference. The outcome of such a gravitational interaction however, depends on this valence. Qualitative difference physicists at currently on working out how to extend the spacetime geometry conception of gravity to subjective physics and the timespace model.

We believe nonetheless, that the reason for any transformation in timespace is due to actual intelligence changing the shape of timespace thus changing the straight-line acceleration of objects by a similar equivalence relation like form general relativity. This may be something as simple as a statement of qualitative equivalence, quality being the analog to mass in spacetime. This is pretty speculative though, so let's leave it to rest.

One important point to remember when thinking about the universal piece computer though, is that every piece--or timespace body--is an entire world of its own. These worlds again, do not overlap. However, in our spatial objective reality, pieces can overlap and nest. If I have a rock, there is an entire world within. Trillions of atoms, each a world in its own are nested within the rock world. In each atom world, electron proton and neutron worlds are nested within. So on to quarks, etc.

This is especially important when considering world piece computers. The amount of overlapping and nesting of world piece computers and all their constituent pieces is quite mind boggling. One of the primary reasons subjective physics has taken off like it has is for its ability to conceptualize worlds in terms of pieces that cannot overlap in timespace. In terms of subjective time, there is very little room for conceptual overlap, again largely because each piece has its own dimension of time. Instead of a mess of worlds all tangled up, we now have a formalism that allows us to treat pieces as if they were part of a puzzle.

Probably the most practical way this serves the universal piece computer harks back to the topic of universal language. Now we can clearly draw a line between overlapping worlds and apply a universal communication protocol to bridge that line between them. This is what the universal piece process does, primarily facilitated by the universal timepiece that manages the connections between all these Human worlds.

This is admittedly super abstract, which is why most people who dive deeper than what we just covered are trained theoretical piece physicists. Qualitative difference physics is the kernel of a world piece computer operating system, while the timespace formalism has more to do with the  first principles that explain the actual hardwear functionality on the fundamental level. Having a solid physical model to understand the nature of Human subjective reality has turned out to be vastly more lucrative than the objective physics that ushered in the advent of the internet, thus paving the way to global peace.

One thing is irrefutable. Inventing a better understanding of time has been invaluable for the process of establishing, measuring, and improving our state of inner and global peace. Timespace as a model is essential for keeping reliable peacetime.

This book is for people who believe that some form of 'world peace' in the form of a global peace system must be erected if we are to ensure our species' survival, and guarantee high quality of life for us and our offspring. To distinguish from 'world peace' -- which is an extremely loaded term eliciting images of hand holding and utopian song -- we will use the term 'global peace' to refer to the pragmatic version of world peace laid out in this book. 

All this makes me a troubled soul. The contents of this book have been haunting me for years, and I fully expect to be haunted for the rest of my life while I work to realize the vision outlined within. My hope is to distribute the burden of realization among people who see what I see and likewise wish to make it real. I hope to find my people, and work with them to make our respective futures downright epic.

If you don't get it, I get it. If you think this is a fool's errand, I get it. If you find this offensive to your sensibilities, I get it. I only expect around 10% of my audience to easily comprehend the significance of what I propose, and that's ok. For the majority, it may take some effort to understand, so I offer this first and foremost as the intellectually stimulating entertainment of a futurist technologist peace nut. I'll even venture to call this art -- call it conceptual peace art, literature. To skeptics, good be skeptical. To the critics, fine criticize me. To the haters, you are not my target audience, so your sentiments mean little to me. For any of you, if you wish to dig into me and this work, please try to keep discourse productive. In most cases, I have more important things to spend my time and energy on than engaging with my opposition. And for the lovers and enthusiasts, please be wary of the intoxicating and destabilizing effects these ideas may have on your worldview. I find it best to approach these ideas with a sober mindset.

From a personal perspective, I just want to make new and better life with people. For us who value grounded and pragmatic notions of peace, for us who believe global peace is worth defining and taking seriously, for those of us who believe the survival of our species depends on our taking peace seriously, for us who just want to be part of something bigger, something exciting, this book is for you. I intend this book to serve as a springboard for networking our like-minds to accelerate the advent of global peace, then maintain and improve upon the standing state of peace art.

And if you read no further, at least ponder this:

Peace is more an evolving continuous iterative process than it is a result or product. What would it mean in your life to treat peace as a process, not a result? I think you stand to profit immensely by asking yourself of this throughout your day-to-day affairs.

And if you read further, let's get it.</Text>

            <Text>1-4 The Grandest Experiment

Whether or not we like it, capitalism is our economic way of doing things. Regardless your take on the merits of capitalism, we can all agree that the system has some very nasty outcomes and that we can count on a better economic system emerging in the future, probably backwards compatible with capitalism. Now, because we cannot visit the past and change any of it, to make peace with capitalism is first to stop quibbling over whether it is good or bad. Then, we must see the past for what it was.

We have experienced an absurd rate of growth in the past 250 years, the past 30 years in particular. The result is a world full of technology that (in principle) improves our quality of life, and a world full of communications infrastructure that completely eliminates geographic separation from the equation. If we can't undo capitalism, we can at least say that we needed it to get this far. The economic incentives as they were drove technological innovation like it did, so here we are take it or leave it by giving up your modern medicine and life-safety technology.

But this does not mean we need to be okay with capitalism now. We have all the infrastructure and the physical and social technology we need to level up our economic systems, so what to do? According to The Economic Peace Thesis, peace is more profitable because it liberates the Trifecta (time, energy, people) for doing useful and creative work. If we all profit more from peace, then it makes sense to seed an economic system around peace and the Trifecta. What would this look like?

For one, 'profit' in such a system will need to be generalized (and I emphatically do not mean profit in strictly the money sense). This means we should not measure profit strictly in terms of modern money. We will need to diversify what we mean when we talk about money, we will need to post-modernize money. If we attempt to valuate somebody's Trifecta, we may need to represent their unique value in terms of a unique value token, and in a way that can be accounted for. I may represent my Trifecta in terms of a new value token called "Blair-bucks", useful for tracking all the little IOUs that are too hard to resolve with regular dollars and cents.

The reasoning goes like this: if everybody--communities included--begin circulating their own value tokens in addition to dollars and cents, we will have a higher volume of circulating currencies (in the post-modern sense) thus we will have more opportunity to capture peace profits in liquid form. In the other direction, more types of currency will give the economy's cashflow much higher resolution because in principle there will be more ledgers for bookkeeping  value exchange the complements the exchange of dollars and cents, thus more data to aid in understanding market movement. If the profitability of peace means we have a system backwards compatible with capitalism, a system with more money, a system with more spending opportunities, a system with more earning opportunities, a system with more data streams and throughput, then this marks a worthy center to begin arranging the grandest experiment.

Everything revolves around money. To quote J. Cole, "stack it up. [money] can't take it when you die, but you can't live without it." If global peace is not economically incentivized, it will never happen. Reflecting on Human Nature, this should be self evident to you.

So the experiment. Back to The Economic Peace Thesis, what we really need to do is perform an experiment to see if peace really is more profitable. This will entail a lot (almost everything we do), hence this will probably be the grandest experiment to date.

First though, let's veer a little to examine the global peace problem more closely. Without getting into detailed nuance (more on that later), solving global peace will be unprecedented in scope, complexity, difficulty, and more. For context, global peace depends on the individual worlds within having inner peace. Every Human has their own world they tend to, and if a Human is at war within, or with others, then that world does not have peace. Every community is a world in itself. Every family is a world in itself. So, this is a lot of data and variables to consider.

In mathematics and physics, solving a problem is much about how well the problem is formulated. If a problem is formulated poorly, it is difficult or impossible to formulate a solution. Further, solving a problem is also about knowing the right math or having the right language, tools, tricks, machinery to do so. Easy problems are well defined, and the mathematical machinery already exists to solve them. Hard problems are poorly defined, and the mathematical machinery does not exist. When a mathematician stumbles across a hard problem, they first focus on finding better language to define it. Once the problem is clearly defined, they proceed to _invent_ whatever machinery (tools and tricks) they need to generate the solution.

Approaching the global peace problem will be similar to approaching hard problems in mathematics. The difference is that to define and frame the global peace problem, we will need to find better language and invent new machinery for every discipline. Sticking to the mathematics example, we will want to frame global peace and its inner workings mathematically. Naturally, as there is no preexisting 'peace math', we will need to find new language to define the global peace problem mathematically, then we will need to invent new machinery to actually generate a solution. This peace math will be just like regular math, but it will be a version that is framed in terms of solving the global peace problem.

The global peace problem will also need engineering, surly, so there will be a similar version-- peace engineering--likewise framed in terms of solving the global peace problem. This peace engineering will be all about design and implementation of global peace. We also have physics. We will need a peace physics. We will need peace economics, we will need peace political science, peace psychology, peace law, and so on. We will need peace art. We will need an all around general peace science. A new version of all disciplines.

With the set of parallel disciplines, we will have the tools we need to define and attempt to solve the global peace problem. Actually doing this however (creating the new discipline versions and solving the problem) will demand more than an handful of peace-themed disciplines. Staying focused, our goal is to determine whether or not (global) peace is really more profitable. To do this we need to make a comparison: profitability now vs profitability of a peace system. We already established that this comparison will be centered about some backwards compatible peace-based alternative to capitalism.

In comparing peace-based vs non peace-based economic systems, all other institutions and entities will fall in place around in comparison. By The Economic Peace Thesis, our hypothesis for the experiment is that the peace-based economic system and all its constituent elements will be more successful (profitable) than their non peace-based counter parts. Peace-based mathematics will be more powerful than non peace-based maths. Peace-based corporations will have higher EBITAs with fewer questionable practices than those corporations that do not explicitly prioritize peace. Peace-based academia will provide better quality education and produce higher quality original research. Peace-based religious denominations will have higher conversion rates than religious denominations that preach fanatic, intolerant, and exclusionary beliefs. Peace-based governmental entities will have less bureaucratic bloat, better reach, etc.

We have to be clear on one thing, however. In order to have confidence in our results, we must think scientifically about this experiment. The thesis needs to be clarified in a way that defines post-modern profit and all the extra value tokens in terms of today's modern profit, one strictly defined in terms of dollars and cents. This will be challenging and a central preliminary problem that the time machine for peace program must solve before any real traction might be gained in the future. This problem cannot be insurmountable.

The grandest experiment therefor, is a comparison of how we do things now vs how we would do things if we approached everything we do explicitly in terms of peace. The experiment's hypothesis is that approaching how we do things in explicit terms of peace will be more effective, bearing more success than our current status quo.

An interesting thing about the grandest experiment is that it should never end. We will go over this more later on, but for now just bear in mind that any solution to the global peace problem will need to continuously evolve to track advancement. We will constantly be comparing present results against the future's more and more peace-based establishment.

We still have a lot to talk about with regard to economics and all the different peace-based disciplines, institutions, and entities.

And moving forward please remember: 'peace-based' means 'based on the concepts of peace outlined in this book'. We will spend plenty of time later to go over what those are but for now we are just setting the stage. So, when I say 

YOUR PERSONAL WORLD PIECE COMPUTER:

For this step, let's do some computer programming, and introduce a new type of computer bit, called pbits.

Let's work on writing your world piece computer's kernel. A kernel in an electronic computer is the most important part of the operating system, and it is what makes it possible for you to interact with all your computer's hardware. All your hardware is different, like all your pieces are different, and they all speak different languages. The kernel is extremely important because it makes it easy for your programs to interact with everything.

Your world piece computer kernel will look different than an electronic computer's kernel because these two computers have different architectures.

We have a few things to do before we are finished writing our kernel, but for now let's start with two tasks:

1) Adopt the economic peace thesis:

Take the economic peace thesis, peace is more profitable, and define what profit means to you. This could be money, energy, satisfaction, anything really. Next a little inventory of what you do in life--work, play, passion, etc. Write these lines of code to adopt the economic peace thesis:

```
- Peace is more profitable because I stand to &lt;&lt;insert your version of profit here&gt;&gt; more if I do things in terms of universal piece.

- This means I will profit more in life if I frame how I &lt;&lt;insert what you do in life&gt;&gt;.in terms of the universal piece process.
```

2) Create your pbit and mint some

Now we need to create your piece computer's value token, or piecebit, pbit for short. I have Blair-bucks, but you can name yours whatever you want. Mint some by creating physical tokens, or simply by adding a number to a ledger that you can use to track your pbits. Whatever you mint, we will add it to our kernel in step (3). I mint Blair-bucks as I go, so that's a valid strategy, too. Create a token symbol for your pbits. Mine is bmakusa.

If you wish to create different types of pbits for different purposes, do so! I keep track of my different pbit by adding a tag to the end of my token, like bmakusa.iou, or bmakusa.bonus.

3) Define the value of your pbits

Your pbits should represent something of value. Sit down and think about how to define your pbit value, especially in terms of your economic peace thesis that you wrote for your kernel above. I sometimes use pbits to pay my different selves. Some pbits are for my time, like the bmakusa Blair-buck. These are for IOUs with friends, family. Other pbits are to keep track of my good and bad sides' behavior. I will pay myself when I notice good behavior and redeem my own pbits by indulging in something. Combine step (2) with this step to write the following code:

```
PBIT_REGISTER:
&lt;&lt; token name   &gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt; token symbol 0 &gt;&gt;	 &lt;&lt; number minted &gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt; token symbol 1 &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; number minted &gt;&gt;
...
&lt;&lt; token symbol n &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; number minted &gt;&gt;
```
Right now my code looks like this:
```
- Peace is more profitable because I stand to find more time, energy, money, contentment, satisfaction, pleasure, fulfillment if I do things in terms of universal piece.

- This means I will profit more in life if I frame how I work on the time machine for peace project, how I do my job, how I interact with people, how I operate my world piece computer in terms of the universal piece process.

PBIT_REGISTER:
Blair-buck
bmakusa		100
bmakusa.mood	1000
bmakusa.wins		1000
```

Now that you have written this code, you need to write it to memory which is the same as adding a piece to your piece computer. The simplest way to do this is to write this code down and put it somewhere you remember and visit often. It should be in a safe place because we don't want your memory to become corrupted. Later on when we program your piece computer's universal piece, will will write in logic that will reference your kernel on a regular basis. If you happen to mint more tokens, or change anything about your thesis, you will want to update your kernel accordingly.

Congratulations! You have written the first part of your world piece computer's kernel! This will be extremely import when it comes to interacting with all the pieces in your world--your hardware.</Text>

            <Text>It wasn't long before physicists extended gravity into timespace. Before the extension, it had long been known that gravitational mass is equivalent to inertial mass. This statement was, as the story goes, the 'happiest moment of his life', a statement made by the ancient physicist Albert Einstein.

If I exert a force on an object--say by kicking a ball--then according to Isaac Newton's first law of motion, the ball will try to stay where it was, as in it has inertia. The amount that the ball fights back against my foot is determined by how much mass the ball has. This mass is what we call inertial mass. The more inertial mass an object has, then the harder it is to change its motion.

On the other hand, if I try to pick the ball up off the ground, I find a different form of resistance, this time due to what we all know as gravity. The amount that gravity makes it hard for me to lift the ball off the ground is also determined by the mass the ball has. This mass is what we call gravitational mass. The more gravitational mass an object has, the harder it is to lift it up in a gravitational field.

The reason this is a big deal, is because it affects the way we think about reference frames. Consider something called an inertial reference frame. An inertial frame is a perspective that is constant in terms of how fast it is going. This could be like you, sitting still looking around at stuff for example. Or, you could be traveling in a car and constant velocity looking out the window at stuff. The thing about inertial reference frames is that no matter if you are sitting stationary, or sitting in a car moving at high speed, it feels like nothing is happening.

But what if the car were to brake and slow down suddenly? In this situation, it feels like something is happening (you lurch forward into your seatbelt which you really should be wearing). Likewise, if the car rounds a turn, it feels like you are being pulled to the opposite direction. Whenever you accelerate, or change how fast you are going, you are then in what we call a non-inertial reference frame. 

So if I take you with me up into space, we will just be floating there. Maybe, we are in a spaceship that has no windows. Maybe we decide to power up its plasma rockets to travel somewhere else. We begin to accelerate and notice the ship moves without us, until we eventually hit the opposite wall. You and I will notice a peculiar thing: if we blast our plasm rockets just hard enough, then the the feeling we experience agains the opposite wall feels exactly the same as if we were laying on the ground down on Earth. In fact, if we keep blasting our rockets at just that rate, then because we have no windows to look out of to see the stars moving, it would be impossible to tell whether or not we were in a rocket ship, or on Earth.

The big conclusion behind Einstein's equivalence principle is that in a non-inertial reference frame, it is impossible to tell whether or not an object is in a gravitational field, or if the non-inertial reference frame is being accelerated.

It took a while for this to really sink in for Humanity.

The realization of the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass paved the way for old general relativity, which at the time was the best description of the macroscopic world that Humanity knew. Einstein--often attributed to the invention of general relativity--was revered as an icon representing the pinnacle of intelligence. After general relativity was invented, our understanding of the cosmos exploded.

General relativity is a theory--a model of reality--that basically says that all objects in spacetime travel in straight lines. The evolution of the universe is just a straight line of massive objects moving through curvilinear spacetime. In order for this to make sense, we have to make another absolute statement: gravity is the curvature of spacetime.

Things get messy though, when we start introducing the forces. Gravity, see, is not a force. Gravity is an apparent force. This means that the feeling of a force is because of circumstances between reference frames, not actually some thing that is forcing. If you are rounding a turn in a car, it may feel like a force is pulling you outward, but the reality is that the reference frame of the car is just moving compared to your reference frame that is still moving forward

The forces are electromagnetic, strong, and weak. Electromagnetic forces cause all the forces that we know in our day to day lives. Weak has to do with how things decay, and strong has to do with how the atoms that make up stuff stay in one piece. We call the theory that explains these three forces quantum field theory. Much like general relativity, quantum field theory became the best description we have of microscopic reality and the interactions between stuff.

For the longest time, a line was drawn between these three forces and gravity. There were pretty obvious mathematical reasons why this was, and a massive effort to unify these three forces with gravity emerged. Entire lives were devoted to this, inventing a GUT or, grand unifying theory of reality.

Meanwhile, it appeared that Humanity was so swept away by their unification efforts, that they lost sight of the original equivalence relation. A few minds however, were still fixating on this relation. Especially with the Higgs field from quantum field theory, it really seemed like there was actually only one type of mass, just, mass. The usual expression of the equivalence principle as it turned out, derives from Newton's second law, which states that when an object experiences force, which causes it to accelerate, and how much it accelerates depends on the object's mass (F = ma). We can also apply Newton's second to the force of gravity (F = mg). The equivalence principle then, is usually written as mg = ma, where m on the lefthand side is gravitational mass, and m on the righthand side is inertial mass.

If we regard mass as just mass, no such thing as inertial or gravitational mass, then the m cancels out in the equivalence relation leaving just g = a. This turned out to be a much more productive expression of the equivalence principle. The resulting statement is simply gravity is the same thing as acceleration, it just looks different from different perspectives. It is challenging to unify the three forces with gravity because that would be like trying to unify yourself with yourself. It's already there. The math was an issue for a long time though, so it was still a non trivial problem to deal with the mess between the mathematics of general relativity and quantum field theory.

The implication of the simplified form of the equivalence principle is that general relativity's statement that stuff travels in straight lines means just that. The three forces are simply the mechanisms for which matter uses to maintain course, in a straight line. So, spacetime is a curvilinear space that is all twisted up in a way that stuff falling through it adhere's to Newton's first law in all cases. Only the reality here, is that Newton's first law needed be adjusted. What once was objects at rest tend to remain at rest and objects in motion tend to remain in motion now became the motion of all objects remains the same. Whether or not an object is moving or stationary is a distinction of the type of motion, where the two types of motion--moving and not-moving--are two sides of the same thing.

Now we have a situation where the object of matter in the universe is just in a state of freefall, falling in a straight line under the influence of gravity. Pretty elegant.

But then, this still has the problem of not being able to explain why things happen. If everything is static, just falling in a straight line, then what causes stuff to change? After generalizing the simplified equivalence principle, we quickly began to focus on a different quantity: the jerk. Jerk is an ancient physics term that means the change in acceleration. Most physicists weren't pure eternalists or determinists, so people were eager to find a better way to think about why stuff changes. At the level of position and velocity, acceleration is clearly the reason why those things change. However, acceleration is just gravity, which is not a force. The changes in position and velocity are only apparent. Acceleration is just gravity, which is just the geometry or curvature of spacetime. Accelerating objects are just falling in a straight line defined by the shape of their surrounding world

So, we need one more time derivative. This is to answer the question of what causes the change in spacetime itself, that is, it's geometry? The jerk does. We can keep going with this line of thought forever, asking, 'what is the cause of the cause of the cause', etc. It's easier if we just stop at the jerk and declare and meta causes are still just changing acceleration, so just focus on the single jerk. We currently believe that the change of acceleration is actually due to intelligence. Ultimately intelligent beings are the ones that make decisions to change something. We came to call this higher quantity than gravity actual intelligence or little ai. Jerk then, or actual intelligence, is just the change in gravity. When we make the decision to accelerate our car, we are changing gravity to make that acceleration happen.

I know this is pretty hard to wrap the brain around, so bear with me.

The reason this is significant now, wraps back to the original treatment of inertial and non-inertial reference frames. In inertial reference frames, things are static. Things just are. Motion is the unchanging state of movement or non-movement. When we--intelligent beings--are in an inertial reference frame, we don't feel anything. If we are accelerated, all of a sudden we feel the force that caused it. But this feeling is just the experience of gravity. If I am sitting in a chair, I experience gravity, but I do not feel a force.

            <Text>1-1 Time Machine For Peace

No, this is not a book about time machines or time travel (unless you want to consider passing into the future a form of time travel). No, this is not a book advocating for utopia, either. This is a book written in the belief that 'world peace' (from now on, 'global peace') will be an inconceivably complex and slippery state to achieve and maintain, but inevitable by nature of inherent profitability of peace. This book offers a unique approach to taking global peace seriously.

Time Machine For Peace is a broad spectrum invention program -- an umbrella project. In the most general terms, the time machine for peace invention program serves as a _vehicle_ whose sole purpose is to transport us in a safe and speedy manner toward our final destination: the advent of global peace and beyond. A large reason this invention program is called a 'time machine' is because the ultimate problem we face as a species is that time, its conjugate variable energy, and people (access to), are exceedingly scarce. To be a vehicle that transports us to a more peaceful and prosperous future will demand systematic management of the limited time, energy, and conflicting interests of said vehicle's passengers, us.

This book presents an exploration of what a time machine for peace invention program might look like. However, the primary emphasis will be on the central project to invent the universal piece computer. We will touch on many diverse and interrelated topics as we go. The ultimate purpose in writing this book is to propose, argue for, and present a call to action for turning what has been an individual effort for many years into a social invention project devoted to accelerating the advent of global peace.

First we take some time to talk about motivating factors, how world peace may be inevitable if we don't kill ourselves off accidentally, then explore a means of experimentally verifying the inevitability of peace. Next, we will give a treatment on 'consilience' (the unification of knowledge), and argue that to even be equipped to solve the problem 'how do we accomplish global peace', we must create versions of mathematics, science, art, engineering, etc, that are all devoted to framing and generating such a solution. We will explore this prospect that if we want to achieve global peace, we must take everything we already do, and create new versions that are contextualized in terms of peace. The segues into the proposed starting point: in order to coordinate such a massive undertaking (solving peace) we must invent a special purpose general computer devoted to treating peace as a process. [ deduplicate versions statements ]

This aforementioned computer is called -- in generic terms -- a _world piece computer_. We will talk all about peace and pieces, which will be confusing at first. At this point we will get into defining what a world piece computer is, what it does, characteristics and properties, and how we might network them together to form a singular supercomputer called -- again in generic terms -- _the universal piece computer_, a supercomputer devoted to computing a solution to the global peace problem. The argument is that we need a network of world piece computers to facilitate the creation of new versions of human institutions, all contextualized in terms of peace. After the universal piece computer is erected, we can then use its computational power to initiate other invention projects under the umbrella of the time machine for peace program.

Next we will close by addressing calls to action. How can you jump in and get involved? How can you help invent the world piece computer to form the universal piece computer? How will collaboration even look like?

Finally, in the epilogue I will discuss the physical motivation underpinning it all. This is largely philosophical with direct appeals to physics and mathematics, by analogy. In brief, our species' understanding of time, consciousness, and evolution is crude to the point that we are incapable of explaining subjectivity, the irreversibility of time, and the reason matter evolves the way it does. I argue that if we ever hope to solve deeper peace-problems such as dying too soon, we need to learn how to systematically violate the second law of thermal dynamics. (The second law is one of the best-validated physical principles, basically stating that there is no free lunch, events are irreversible, and everything must crumble or die, eventually.) If we can coordinate the creation of a physical model or theory of reality framed in terms of time, qualitative experience (consciousness), and intelligence, we may find hope to discover ways we might avoid the seeming inevitability of extinction.

I sincerely hope you enjoy exploring these grandiose and exciting ideas alongside me. I likewise hope you draw something -- inspiration, insight, hope, etc -- from this work.</Text>

            <Text>Opening

This book is dedicated to victims of generalized war.

I do not necessarily suggest we all change how we do things; I suggest we all change our _approach_ to how we do things. I think we can do better to prioritize peace as an explicit process, not a result. I think we need to take global peace more seriously.

Disclaimers regarding my writing style:

To be clear, I only care to communicate the gestalt of this idea effectively to the right people and this book will only scratch the surface. By nature of my temperament I tend to make loose associations, thus I meander like a lazy river. I hold true to gravity though. I also frequently make definitive and authoritative statements without proof or justification. My language is somewhat professorial, so I apologize for that. But I really don't care much about reaching every audience member perfectly. I'm intent to make this stuff real, not speak at book clubs and signing events.

Please bear in mind that this book contains my version and vision of things. Yours will look different than mine, and that's ok. Be patient and open minded; your blood pressure will thank you.Forward

This book is for people who believe that some form of 'world peace' in the form of a global peace system must be erected if we are to ensure our species' survival, and guarantee high quality of life for us and our offspring. To distinguish from 'world peace' -- which is an extremely loaded term eliciting images of hand holding and utopian song -- we will use the term 'global peace' to refer to the pragmatic version of world peace laid out in this book. 

All this makes me a troubled soul. The contents of this book have been haunting me for years, and I fully expect to be haunted for the rest of my life while I work to realize the vision outlined within. My hope is to distribute the burden of realization among people who see what I see and likewise wish to make it real. I hope to find my people, and work with them to make our respective futures downright epic.

If you don't get it, I get it. If you think this is a fool's errand, I get it. If you find this offensive to your sensibilities, I get it. I only expect around 10% of my audience to easily comprehend the significance of what I propose, and that's ok. For the majority, it may take some effort to understand, so I offer this first and foremost as the intellectually stimulating entertainment of a futurist technologist peace nut. I'll even venture to call this art -- call it conceptual peace art. To skeptics, good be skeptical. To the critics, fine criticize me. To the haters, you are not my target audience, so your sentiments mean little to me. For any of you, if you wish to dig into me and this work, please try to keep discourse productive. In most cases, I have more important things to spend my time and energy on than engaging with my opposition. And for the lovers and enthusiasts, please be wary of the intoxicating and destabilizing effects these ideas may have on your worldview. I find it best to approach these ideas with a sober mindset.

From a personal perspective, I just want to make new and better life with people. For us who value grounded and pragmatic notions of peace, for us who believe global peace is worth defining and taking seriously, for those of us who believe the survival of our species depends on our taking peace seriously, this book is for you. I intend this book to serve as a springboard for networking our like-minds to accelerate the advent of global peace, then maintain and improve upon the standing state of peace art.

And if you read no further, at least ponder this:

Peace is more an evolving continuous iterative process than it is a result or product. What would it mean in your life to treat peace as a process, not a result? I think you stand to profit immensely by asking yourself of this throughout your day-to-day affairs.

And if you read further, let's get it.



Forward 2

My goal in providing you this book is to teach you a new language that literally rewires your brain in terms of peace, which by my belief will change the way you think act for the better.

Compared to your default ways, I think you stand to benefit -- profit even -- from seeing and interacting with the world around you in terms of peace.

As an experiment, I would like to know whether or not people who think in terms of peace do live more profitable lives.

If you read this book and commit to understanding by internalizing its contents (which I highly recommend), you become a member of the experiment's test population. If you read this book and do not internalize the contents, you become a member of the experiment's neutral population. And if you do not read this book, you belong to the control (default) population.

N = 1 studies, surveys, polls will be conducted after some minimum readership has been established, and enough time passed. The results may be published in future editions.

Eventually we will have access to the resources we need (test and control populations, scientific and medical facilities) to perform more sophisticated studies. This will certainly include comparing brain activity between subjects using CT and MRI scans of their brains. Scans will also help us determine correlates between brain structure and peace-based thought patterns.

Ultimately this research will map general peace-related experience to brain function and structure, and this will give us the opportunity to determine a difference map between peaceful thought, neutral thought, and warlike thought. Identifying key differences should lead to insights into how to lessen differences by root cause analysis.

Part 1 - 101

This first part sets the stage and is a prerequisite for the main course. My job is to teach you the concepts you will need to participate in, or think critically about this program.

Through my travels speaking with people, a resounding theme is that education will be one of the critical aspects underpinning effective global peace. This book shares qualities of a text book, and me being the author, am here to teach you all about this massive vision that's been stewing in my head for well over a decade. The reason this is educational and not just the quirky entertainment of a futurist, is that I genuinely believe that the contents of this text are invaluable, that they have the ability to help and enhance your world, and to do so now.

Thus, drawing from Verbal Judo's model for education, the educational objective is to motivate you enough to learn a novel way of thinking about peace and computers. The educational goal is use these learnings to expand your mind about what our options are when it comes to the hard question of how to go about solving the war and peace problem. With these learnings and an expanded mind, the hope is that you will have the resources you need to bring peace to your world, and if you already have peace, to enhance it.

Let's begin.

1-2 Peace Is Inevitable

From here out, we will refer to the triplet of time, energy, and people as the 'Trifecta'.

Anecdotally, peace is the most valuable thing. Peace makes it possible for me to make the most of my Trifecta, for the purpose of creating new life with others while making life more awesome for everybody involved. War (effectively the absence of peace) diverts precious time and energy toward destroying life with others, and generally making life much less awesome. (In pathological cases, destruction and annihilation is a form of peace-seeking, but let's leave that aside for now.)

So although the Trifecta are the scarcest resources thus valuable in their own rite, they mean nothing if they are not utilized. If you spend all your time and energy trying to avoid being destroyed in a war, you don't get to use any of that resource to enjoy life, build relationships, create. [shaky]

At first glance, 'peace is inevitable' is a questionable statement. What would compel somebody to say such a thing? It sure doesn't look like peace is inevitable, in fact, it often seems impossible to attain.

Here's another take on the value of peace. In times of war, people will go so far as to kill for peace. The idea of going to war is to realize an existential entitlement that conflicts with somebody else. Peace is so valuable that people will give up everything but their lives (and sometimes even their lives) in times of war to regain peace. People may even take to the offensive to realize some greater form of their peace by provoking violent conflict. In war, people will sacrifice their Trifecta, for the chance to attain the version of peace they feel entitled to. In other words, war is the ultimate cost of peace. Quantifying, we can safely say that peace is at least as valuable as all the resource expended during times of war. Given that it is easier to destroy than it is to create, this is a lot of value. War has carries an absurdly high opportunity cost.

Circling back to the Trifecta, peace is the meaningful liberation of these resources. War is to sacrifice these things. Peace liberates the immense value of the Trifecta. War destroys the value. 'Peace is inevitable' then, just means that the greed of Human Nature will prevail. We crave more and more (and better) time and energy, and we will stop at nothing to get it. The Trifecta is so valuable that these resources are cherished by millionaires and billionaires around the world. Money becomes an ancillary concern once the time, energy and expertise of people are harnessed properly. The reason millionaires and billionaires are so filthy rich is that they know the value of the Trifecta, and they know how to harness it. 'Peace is inevitable' still needs some more justification. Just because peace is valuable doesn't mean peace is inevitable.

Napoleon was know for saying, 'it is not enough to just succeed; one must also profit from their success'. So it is probably not enough to just achieve peace, but people usually pair 'peace' with 'prosperity' where peace sets the stage for prosperity. Besides for maybe war mongers, everybody prospers more in times of peace. Prosperity is the profit that makes peace worth having. Millionaires and billionaires know exactly how profitable the trifecta is.

So put simply, 'peace is inevitable' is to say that peace is profitable. But I _don't_ mean profitable in the strict monetary sense. Rather, I mean profitable in terms of whatever currency one values most. For many people, this currency may be time itself. During peacetime globally, economy is stable and growing. Locally, people have higher quality of life and more affluence. Especially in our capitalistic world, if peace is more profitable than war, then peace is simply inevitable.

This treatment so far has been more from the global and local perspective of peoples or society being at war or peace. Back to the anecdote, this all applies equally well to the individual perspective. That is, I profit more from peace than I do from war, be it interpersonal or internal. (And again, the profit is derived from the prosperity I can generate with my free time, energy, and people that would otherwise be lost to war.)

If one is at war within, or at war with another person, they become so fixated on how to end the war that all their time and energy goes toward waging war instead of living in peace. The more intense the inner or interpersonal war, the greater the lengths -- the more time and energy one will spend to attain peace. In the pathological cases, the war is so consuming and destructive that people resort to extreme and irreversible measures to find peace. In the worst cases, peace is not a perceived possibility due to the intensity of war, so efforts are made to end the war at all costs for relief. This is where killing becomes an issue.

If somebody dies because of war, this is the ultimate loss of value. Time and energy cease to matter for the deceased. Any time and energy that person had available in the future is revoked, no more.

The people in charge of things are smart though. There are pathological cases where somebody in charge wages war for profit, but in most part these people understand that peace makes people more money etc, and peace enhances people's quality of life. The incentive of profit is clearly there, thus for now at least, peace is inevitable.

Regarding the military industrial complex, there is a Latin saying, "si vis pacum, para bellum", which means, "if you want peace, prepare for war." Peace advocates are generally quick to denounce the wisdom of this tidbit as 'no longer applicable', but I do not believe this the case. Although the military industrial complex will need to pivot and adopt new business models, there will always be a need for military preparation (with the exception of nuclear arms, which are just stupid). The harsh fact is that no matter how peaceful we become, there will always be bad guys (and gals) who wish to conquer and harm for the sake of it. Until the universal piece computer is fully functioning and integrated into society, we must assume that there are people capable and willing to go out of their way to make war. (Ahem, Putin, etc.)

To really hammer at it, consider the course of civilization. Although the Global Peace Index [insert tidbit explaining GPI] has been eroding in the past 10-20 years, overall we live in one of the most peaceful eras known to Humanity. As we have less war and fewer tyrannical dictators in charge, our global economy has surged with growth and technological innovation. The rising tide of peace floats all boats (though some an unjust amount more than others). There is still extreme disparity between affluence and poverty, but it is safe to say that everybody benefits to some extent from the booming global economy. (Again, there are plenty of pathological cases in apparent disagreement with the above.)

So I end this section with "The Economic Peace Thesis":

"Peace is more profitable."
1-3 We Can't Wait!

The inevitability of peace only makes sense by making a little caveat: global peace may be inevitable, but only if we don't go extinct first. This seems like a pretty obvious and trivial statement but it bears inspection. We cannot just sit back and expect global peace to happen.

From one angle, our extinction very well may be imminent, as we grapple with the consequences of global warming and impending peak population among other things. Likewise, as tensions mount in more and different ways on the global stage, the possibility of world nuclear war or a third world war is real. From another angle, without introducing any new knowledge to the equation of how we understand reality, extinction may be physically inevitable.

In any case, for us to be at peace with the looming threat of extinction, we must be able to honestly tell ourselves that we are doing everything we can to ensure our survival. Unfortunately backing up our species on Mars doesn't mean much if we cannot find the will to unify and deliberately situate ourselves to face our existential problems on Earth with solidarity.

Stated without proof or justification, it very well may be that we cannot solve our deepest existential problems as a species if we do not learn how to prioritize peace on a global scale. When the stakes are survival itself, it makes conservative sense to _assume_ we need to put global peace first. If we can create a meaningful form of global peace, we stand to liberate that much more Human time and energy for the purpose of studying and solving our existential problems. If it turns out we do not need to prioritize peace, yet we attain it anyway, then the liberated time and energy will make it that much sooner that we solve problems like global warming and peak population.

Assuming we _do_ need global peace to overcome our existential problems, given the progression of global warming we will need to attain some semblance of global peace in the next 10-20 years. If we can leverage the powers of exponential growth and explosive percolation within networks (more on that later) this may indeed be possible.

People are constantly talking about what will be the death of us. Many people believe this will be global warming, many others believe this will be the erosion of our traditions, our institutions, our values, etc. In every case the scenario is the same: we have a ton of different people all yelling at once about what they think the most important death-of-us problem is to face. If we are to ever have hope for thinking straight about these issues, we will first need to stop shouting so much. The circular catch is that the only thing that will make the shouting stop is the calmness of peace, but to have peace and calm people need to stop shouting. It seems like most of the shouting is born from fear and anger at injustice or futility.

It seems this type of fear and anger is often a reaction to the feeling that we aren't taking this or that death-of-us problem seriously enough. What we need for us to all stop shouting at once, is the common knowledge that no matter what death-of-us problem you get riled up about, we as Humans have a single global peace system in place that is fostered to ensure we are methodically and deliberately taking all death-to-us problems seriously. Similar to how the presence of a police and fire department make it easy to live homelives carefree of scary stuff, an effective global peace system would likely have a similar calming and soothing effect. Certainly there are people who will never stop shouting, but for those people such a peace system would validate and record the content of the shouting, then build some sort of figurative 'noise box' to contain the din.

A vagabond once suggested that global peace would be more aptly called 'The Great Hush'. We can't work together as a species if we cannot find a way to hear ourselves over the din of Humanity. If one is faced with a crisis or a existential threat, the obvious advice is to remain calm, cool, and collected, think, and avoid hysteric panic at all costs. If we want global peace, we need to learn how to shut up. If we can't shut up, we need to ensure that the people capable of impact have channels in place that facilitates communication between them, despite the noise.

So the prudent course: Healthy pessimism dictates we assume that global peace is a prerequisite to solving our hardest problems. Then, healthy optimism dictates we assume global peace is an inevitability. Finally, healthy realism dictates we assume the worst and design for the best. We cannot sit back and expect global peace to happen, so we must instill some urgency and make it happen. Put plainly, don't wait. Global peace needs to be explicitly prioritized, and now.

1-4 The Grandest Experiment

Whether or not we like it, capitalism is our economic way of doing things. Regardless your take on the merits of capitalism, we can all agree that the system has some very nasty outcomes and that we can count on a better economic system emerging in the future, probably backwards compatible with capitalism. Now, because we cannot visit the past and change any of it, to make peace with capitalism is first to stop quibbling over whether it is good or bad. Then, we must see the past for what it was.

We have experienced an absurd rate of growth in the past 250 years, the past 30 years in particular. The result is a world full of technology that (in principle) improves our quality of life, and a world full of communications infrastructure that completely eliminates geographic separation from the equation. If we can't undo capitalism, we can at least say that we needed it to get _this far_. The economic incentives as they were drove technological innovation like it did, so here we are take it or leave it.

But this does not mean we need to be okay with capitalism now. We have all the infrastructure and the physical and social technology we need to level up our economic systems, so what to do? According to The Economic Peace Thesis, peace is more profitable because it liberates the Trifecta (time, energy, people) for doing useful and creative work. If we all profit more from peace, then it makes sense to seed an economic system around peace and the Trifecta. What would this look like?

For one, 'profit' in such a system will be generalized. This means we should not measure profit strictly in terms of fiscal currency. We will need to diversify what we mean when we talk about money. If we attempt to valuate somebody's Trifecta, we may need to represent their unique value in terms of a unique currency, and in a way that can be accounted for. I may represent my Trifecta in terms of a new currency called "Blair-bucks", useful for tracking all the little IOUs that are too hard to resolve with regular dollars and cents.

The reasoning goes like, if everybody -- communities included -- begin circulating their own currencies in addition to dollars and cents, we will have more money in circulation thus we will have more opportunity to capture peace profits in liquid form. In the other direction, more _types_ of currency will give the economy's cashflow much higher resolution because in principle there will be more ledgers for bookkeeping thus more data to aid in understanding market movements. If the profitability of peace means we have a system backwards compatible with capitalism, a system with more money, a system with more spending opportunities, a system with more earning opportunities, a system with more data streams and throughput, then this marks a worthy center to begin arranging the grandest experiment.

Everything revolves around money. To quote J. Cole, "stack it up. [money] can't take it when you die, but you can't live without it." If global peace is not economically incentivized, it will never happen.

So the experiment. Back to The Economic Peace Thesis, what we really need to do is perform an experiment to see if peace really is more profitable. This will entail a lot (almost everything), hence this will probably be the grandest experiment to date.

First though, let's veer a little to examine the global peace problem more closely. Without getting into detailed nuance (more on that later), solving global peace will be unprecedented in scope, complexity, difficulty, and more. For context, global peace depends on the individual worlds within having peace. Every Human has their own world they tend to, and if a Human is at war within, or with others, then that world does not have peace. Every community is a world in itself. Every family is a world in itself. So, this is a lot of data and variables to consider.

In mathematics solving a problem is more about how well the problem is formulated. If a problem is formulated poorly, it is difficult to be concise about a solution. Further, solving a problem is also about knowing the right math or having the right language, tools, tricks, machinery to do so. Easy problems are well defined, and the mathematical machinery already exists to solve them. Hard problems are poorly defined, and the mathematical machinery does not exist. When a mathematician stumbles across a hard problem, they first focus on finding better language to define it. Once the problem is clearly defined, they proceed to _invent_ whatever machinery (tools and tricks) they need to generate the solution.

Approaching the global peace problem will be similar to approaching hard problems in mathematics. The difference is that to define and frame the global peace problem, we will need to  find better language and invent new machinery for _every_ discipline. Sticking to the mathematics example, we will want to frame global peace and its inner workings mathematically. Naturally, as there is no preexisting 'peace math', we will need to find new language to define the global peace problem mathematically, then we will need to invent new machinery to actually generate a solution. This peace math will be just like regular math, but it will be a version that is framed in terms of peace.

The global peace problem will also need engineering, surly, so there will be a similar peace engineering version. This peace engineering will be all about design and implementation of global peace. We also have physics. We will need a peace physics. We will need peace economics, we will need peace political science, peace psychology, peace law, and so on. We will need peace art. We will need an all around general peace science. A new version of all disciplines.

With these parallel disciplines, we will have the tools we need to define and attempt to solve the global peace problem. Actually doing this however (creating the new discipline versions and solving the problem) will demand more than an handful of peace-themed disciplines. Staying focused, our goal is to determine whether or not (global) peace is really more profitable. To do this we need to make a comparison: profitability now vs profitability of a peace system. We already established that this comparison will be centered about some backwards compatible peace-based alternative to capitalism.

In comparing peace-based vs non peace-based economic systems, all other institutions and entities will fall in place around in comparison. By The Economic Peace Thesis, our hypothesis for the experiment is that the peace-based economic system and all its constituent elements will be more successful (profitable) than their non peace-based counter parts. Peace-based mathematics will be more powerful than non peace-based maths. Peace-based corporations will have higher EBITAs than those corporations that do not explicitly prioritize peace. Peace-based academia will provide better quality education and produce higher quality original research. Peace-based religious denominations will have higher conversion rates than religious denominations that preach fanatic, intolerant, and exclusionary beliefs. Peace-based governmental entities will have less bureaucratic bloat, better reach, etc.

The Grandest Experiment therefor, is a comparison of how we do things now vs how we would do things if we approached everything we do explicitly in terms of peace. The experiment's hypothesis is that approaching how we do things in explicit terms of peace will be more effective, bearing more success than our current status quo.

An interesting thing about The Grandest Experiment is that it should never end. We will go over this more later on, but for now just bear in mind that any solution to the global peace problem will need to continuously evolve to track advancement. We will constantly be comparing present results against the future's more and more peace-based establishment.

We still have a lot to talk about with regard to economics and all the different peace-based disciplines, institutions, and entities. We'll touch back on those later.

And moving forward please remember: 'peace-based' means 'based on the concepts of peace outlined in this book'. We will spend plenty of time later to go over what those are but for now we are just setting the stage.

1-5 Consilience

This chapter, like the rest in this section, is a prelude for the next section where we get into describing the central invention project in the Time Machine For Peace program. Here we discuss one of the primary functions of the world piece computer: knowledge unification.

Consilience was first popularized by the biologist Edward O Wilson. The idea is that instead of disciplines becoming more and more specialized, siloed and out of touch with each other, we should instead endeavor to bring knowledge together into a whole, unified via a common language (a universal 'knowledge language' so to speak. More technically, this is to create an _ontology_ from all the discrete bodies of knowledge, all the various disciplines.

Unifying knowledge is important in two main regards:

The first is that in terms of solving the global peace problem, we need all the tools we can get. If knowledge is unified, for example to unify art and science, we are more able to traverse to and fro between pure art and pure science at will. The value in this comes from the fact that merging disciplines introduces new language. Art language may be applied to science, and science language may be applied to art. This is powerful because this allows us to make novel -- and more -- associations. If I am a scientist, I can think of my experiment design as an art. The experiment has a gestalt, it has different tone and texture that must be managed. It has instruments in the same way a studio has supplies. The creative process cannot be neglected. On the flipside, if I am an artist, I can think of my current piece as an experiment. There is discovery involved, there is precision control of variables such as stroke weight, length, etc. I can take an unsatisfactory work and turn it into an experiment where I vary parameters, creating hypotheses along the way, to achieve better technique and results. The scientific method cannot be neglected. Cross pollination between peace-based disciplines will provide us with more insight we need to tackle the global peace problem.

The second regard has to do with individual knowledge (and experience). We all have different knowledge we have accumulated over time, and it serves us in many beneficial ways. My knowledge contains insights, knowhow, and tricks (among other things) that serve me very well in my day-to-day. However, you probably don't know all my tricks and insights and knowhow. Likewise me to you, I cannot know all the value you store in your knowledge bank. So, say you and I share similar problems or difficulties. We are both on the hunt for new ways of approaching the same old problems, and the quickest way to do so is to access the person aspect of the Trifecta (doing so however, is at the expense of time and energy). You and I stand to profit by making peace (if not so), and working together to exchange our respective language. We both learn new things and we both walk away from the exchange better equipped to face reality. (Unifying individual knowledge always reminds me of the Vulcan mind meld, but unfortunately we don't have it so easy as telepathy.) The more people unify knowledge with one another, the more equipped we are to solve our hardest problems. The more unification, the more mutual understanding, thus the less likely we are to fall victim to accidental conflict.

So what is the glue here? Be it individuals or disciplines, unifying knowledge has the common element of _language_. In order to unify two bodies of knowledge, there must be a higher degree of _understanding_ between them. If I try to understand your knowledge without knowing how to speak your language, I will fail. Likewise, the people tasked with unifying two disciplines must have the ability to understand the language of both. Language is the glue.

Sometimes understanding language is difficult and nuanced. For example, you and I may both use the word 'dangerous' at times. You may by default say 'dangerous' and mean 'unsafe', whereas I may by default mean 'extremely competent'. If you and I were unifying our knowledge, we may actually need to invent our own shared language between us. The shared language is only ever supplemental (or not, as in the case of invented languages like Esperanto), so we won't need much and in many cases we can invent it as we go.

Things of course get more complicated the more disciplines' and individuals' knowledge we attempt to unify at once. Here we are forced to find something common, but the problem with concepts that span many realms of discourse is that said concepts are often extremely vague and loose, with a myriad meanings between contexts and people. Shared language in this case must be more deliberately crafted.

Thankfully, if we are speaking in terms of unifying peace-based versions of disciplines, this makes the choice of language glue very easy. Such a shared language will revolve about the concept of _peace_ (and as my effort is concerned, the concept of peace as drawn out in this book). Likewise, peace-minded individuals will have an easy time adopting a peace-based shared language because the Time Machine For Peace program is so large it will be infeasible without.

It is tempting to draw back and exclaim, "you’re talking about inventing a universal language!" Not so fast, well, not yet at least. Language in general is 'living' they say. This means it is constantly changing, each news cycle, each inside joke, each movie and new piece of slang. Inventing a shared language cannot constitute a universal language because there is no machinery to facilitate the process of language exchange and evolution. When I say 'universal' I mean so in the sense that I use the word in this book. We'll get to that later or you can check the glossary but suffice to say, 'universal' in this context means between and among worlds. Universal language will not just include a standard language (grammar, lexicon, etc) but it will also include a process -- protocols even -- for connecting worlds of individuals and disciplines. Said process will include procedures (or agreements) to exchange, verify, correct, adjust, etc, the peace-based shared language. These procedures in general will focus on knowledge unification and learning, an educational process.

This is what we will address in section two. We will explore how the concepts of a _world piece computer_ and _the universal piece computer_ will serve as this machinery of language exchange and evolution. World piece computers networked into the universal piece computer, coupled with the shared peace-based language, will be the proper universal language.

Knowledge should live on one tree. The knowledge tree should have only one trunk. By creating peace-based versions of institutions, entities, ourselves, we stand to achieve a meaningful and purpose-driven form of consilience where the trunk is a universal concept of peace. Before we can unify as a people, we will need to begin tackling the unification of knowledge. Before we can do that, we need to disambiguate between the different types of peace that I will use throughout .
1-6 Disambiguating Peace - terminology

So far I've been using 'peace' without actually addressing how 'peace' as a concept is used in the Time Machine For Peace program. Peace and world peace are the most common peace nouns. Let's establish some rules and define terms. This will be essential to understanding in section two and beyond.

This defines the core of the shared language I propose. A glossary and specification found in appendix[].

First, I will refrain from using the phrase 'world peace'. It is too loaded, charged, and elicits imagery of fantasy utopias and kumbaya nonsense. (Kumbaya btw, originated as a German word meaning 'come from God'.) Instead, we will define 'global peace' as the mature big brother of world peace. Global peace is realistic, messy, chaotic. Global peace is to treat peace on a global scale (species wide), as the _product_ of the global peace system we erect. It is the system's state in any given moment. Likewise, we will add two more versions of global peace to represent a group's local world peace, and an individual's personal world peace.

world peace -&gt; global peace (global scale)
world peace -&gt; local peace (group scale)
world peace -&gt; individual peace (person scale)

Next, I throw away 'peace', as it is too vague. Every Human being on the planet has a different understanding of what 'peace' means, so this is way too much to contend with (at least for now). Like 'world peace', it will be more productive to just leave 'peace' as it is in general use. However, one exceedingly common usage of 'peace' is to mean 'inner peace'. We will use the following:

peace -&gt; inner peace (within person)

If that isn't enough, this next rule is by far the most irritating aspect of the language choice moving forward. (It absolutely drives people crazy, but this is more a fault of my poor communication skills and their inability to think fluidly.) Bear with me for now.From now on, in place of 'peace' and 'world peace', we will use 'piece' and 'world piece'. Besides 'global peace', 'piece' and 'world piece' are in fact the most important substitutions we can make. Like 'peace', the concept of a 'piece' becomes part of the knowledge tree's trunk. Most of this has to do with the fledgling piece-based physics that guides this program's efforts. (Section three will dive deep into this, but for now it goes to state that our universe's evolution of real matter and imaginary constructs is best described as a singular blob of pieces. The similarity between 'peace' and 'piece' in the English language may be misfortunate, but then again, there may certainly be a link between 'peace' as a concept, and 'piece' as a thing.

piece (not peace)
world piece (not world peace)

Finally, we have to make the most important language distinction: peace as a process vs peace as a product (or result). Usually when somebody says 'peace', what they are referring to a static but temporary state of being (death being an exception). People often mean things like 'tranquil', 'calm', or 'still' when they say 'peaceful'. These are states of being that are pleasant and we work to attain them. This work we do to attain pleasant things is a dynamic and continuous process, and how we approach the work we do must change all the time to adapt to changing circumstance. The calm will only last until the storm comes. A bystander who was once enjoying the calm will now do work to return to calm; they will seek shelter or they will find better weather.

This constant effort to return to good states of being is peace as a process, and we will call 'the universal piece' from now on.

{{
Universal Peace is the name of a peace advocacy  foundation that approaches peace from the perspective of unifying religions. We use under case 'universal piece' which a general concept and not the same as Universal Peace Foundation's work. If they have issue with the use of 'universal piece' in this program, I will consider 'unipeace', more likely I'll just contend.
}}

So the origin of 'theuniversal piece' goes like this: 
"
[original language preserved] If we want to take world peace seriously, we need to consider the sources of war -- people. If an individual is at war with themself or the world in any way, this is liable to spill over into other individuals' lives. This becomes a local state of war (generalized), which would disqualify any claim to world peace.

Thus, to attain world peace, we must ensure that each individual Human world is at peace first (again, inner peace), and every family, and every community, etc [we can see language becomes an issue here].

But each world has a different notion of world peace, all 8 billion Human worlds plus all the other group worlds beyond that. It would seem that 'world peace' is not a great concept to refer to when talking about idealized global peace. Instead it makes more sense to think in terms of how to get all these 'world peace' versions to align in a way the maximizes the good and minimizes the bad.

That is the purpose the universal piece serves. It serves as a process that continuously arranges/rearranges, connects/ disconnects Human worlds to find the optimal fit for a given set of circumstances. Because circumstances change, the universal piece process must be constantly evolving. As solutions to the universal piece we be bad at first, then steadily improve, this means the process is what we call 'iterative'. Calling on variational and numerical principles from mathematics, we can systematically explore the global peace solution space, then converge on better world-configuration solutions over time. For the sake of remaining simple (and for the sake of some considerations we will put off for now) we will define the universal piece as being 'singular'. This means that there can be only one universal piece process.

We will revisit the universal piece soon, but for now I hope this language primer will save some confusion later on. All the concepts and terms above are essential if you and I want to better make sure we're on the same page.1-7 Peace / Piece Computers

Before we broach section 2, although there are many motivations, let's take a moment to go over the primary motivation underpinning the contents.

We have established that for global peace to make sense, we must adopt peace as a process that we define as the universal piece. At the global scale -- even local and individual – the universal piece process involves a massive amount of data, variables, and information. In mathematics, the universal piece may be considered the iterative solution to what we call an 'optimization problem'. The specific optimization problem is to find the best way to arrange all the individual worlds, group worlds, and other worlds, such that good stuff is maximized and bad stuff is minimized. This is a very large number of objects, variables, and conditions to account for.

Solving optimization problems that have many variables quickly becomes impossible to so by hand due to the amount of work involved. However, to the delight of modern mathematics and engineering, we invented the classical electronic computer to perform all the heavy lifting for optimization problems. Ever since the advent of the electronic computer, we have been using them to solve complex mathematics and engineering problems, responsible for the marvels of technology as we know today. There are limits to classical electronic computers regarding optimization problem -- this is where quantum computer becomes relevant -- but for now we should skip talking quantum.

So we have a spectacularly epic optimization problem -- global peace. The universal piece is the singular process that iteratively solves global peace. So here we are. We have an optimization problem and we have a process to solve the problem. If only we had something that could help us run the process faster, with more data and capacity!

Thus it makes sense that if computers are good at processing data (using the Von Neumann load-store architecture), and if they are good at running programs to solve optimization problems, then if we want global peace to happen then we should probably invent a special purpose computer that runs the universal piece process nonstop. This special computer will be called 'the universal piece computer' from now on, and by definition there may only be one.

Due to the vast computational needs for such a large optimization problem, logic would suggest the compute power (hardware) should be distributed on a global scale and decentralized. What we would have as a basic shape for the universal piece computer would be a network of compute nodes -- or clusters -- spread out across the planet. In the world of classical computers we typically form large computers out of many smaller computers. Networking techniques that make the internet possible also make bonding computers into a single computer possible.

At this point we have painted a picture of a single special computer spread out across the planet. It runs a single process that solves a single optimization problem to calculate the best configuration of Human worlds in a given moment. Let's go ahead an use a new vocabulary term introduced in the last part. We shall refer to Human worlds as being 'world pieces', and these are the objects that the universal piecce computer generates optimized configurations for.

Because compute nodes for the universal piece computer will always be controlled by somebody, these individual nodes will exist within a world piece, which is Human world that contains the node. To actually implement the universal piece computer, it will make most sense to create nodes that are their own individual computers. Just like the universal piece computer as a whole, these smaller computers will help run universal piece by running just the portion of the universal piece that serves their own world. We shall call each one of these contributing computers a 'world piece computer'. Unlike the universal piecece computer, world piece computers are plural, but only one world piece computer may be controlled by a single world at any given time.

The universal piece running within a world piece computer is a little different than running globally as a whole on the universal piece computer. In a world, the process of creating, returning to, and maintaining good and pleasant times is still the (same) universal piece, but the specific objects that the universal piece is solving the optimization problem for are both other world pieces (those not controlled by this Human world) and for simple non world pieces on their own. Pieces within a world piece may be any significant thing within that world. If you have a rain jacket in your backpack and a storm falls, your world piece computer will recognize that your rain jacket piece should be reconfigured so to be positioned on your torso. This will get the operator back to the pleasant experience of 'warm and dry'.

That should do it for now. The universal piece computer is comprised of participating world piece computers all contributing to the singular process of the universal piece. Each world piece computer runs the universal piece for its own world's pieces. World pieces that do not participate in running the universal piece are still included in global peace configuration solutions. And gluing all this together? To unify all of the above we naturally fall back to the modern communications infrastructure brought to us in large part by the innovating forces of capitalism!

This ends Part 1. Now we make a deeper dive into more about how the universal piece computer works.Part 2 - Main Course

The next several chapters are the main course of this learning program.

Here we will take the time we need to explore the center-point of this text. That is, the universal piece computer, world piece computers, what they do, how they work, and how they interact with each other.

Much of this can become confusing or overwhelming at times, especially with all the 'peace this' and 'peace that’s' flying around. My advice if this happen to you is to treat this section like a theoretical physicist treats new concepts: sometimes when you really don't understand what is being said in a particular page or equation, you should just carry on reading. Carrying on, the broader meaning depicted will usually emerge, allowing you the opportunity to double back and revisit that confusing part you read past.

I also encourage you to write things and speak things aloud as you go. Flexing the motor cortex to learn new things goes a long way.

Finally, try to keep the following motivating questions in the back of your head while you read: What would my personal world piece computer look like? What would my community's world piece computer look like? What would my aspect of the universal piece process look like? What would the universal piece computer as a whole look like?

Let's carry on.2-1 Computer Riff

The main course (this part) is all about computers. Before we can talk in depth about the universal piece computer and world piece computers, we set things up by riffing on computers as we know them today. In subsequent sections we will work in reverse spanning from the simple 'world piece', working out way up to the complexities of the universal piece computer. Concluding all this will be several sections on how to apply the learnings in this part.

So, these days when people hear the noun 'computer' they almost all think only of an electronic slab of silicon, a glowing colorful window to look inside, a board with lots of little keys to select symbols from, and maybe a little thing shaped like a mouse to point at stuff. Inside the computer you know are programs, some of them the computer uses for its own things, and some of them are applications for you to use. Sometimes the computer is big and needs a desk to live on, sometimes it is smaller and needs a lap to live on, and sometimes it is tiny and needs a pocket to live in. Finally, for various reasons we can get into maybe later, a large number of people sincerely dislike everything about computers.

That's the modern computer. This kind of computer I will from hereon refer to as an 'electronic computer in the Von Neumann load-store architecture', 'electronic computer', or ‘classical computer’ for short.

There are some of us who are more in the know. We are the ones who hear 'computer' and think 'device that manipulates signals and symbols'. Without stretching too much at first, we can immediately extend the notion of electronic computer beyond consumer versions. This may be up in scale such as massive high throughput supercomputers that fill entire buildings, or it may be down in scale such as embedded computers small enough to fit need tweezers to handle. All these electronic computers are digital meaning the symbols they manipulate are binary '1' and '0', and they use sampling to convert between analog signals and digital bits. For these computers, 

Speaking of analog, a more obscure (older mainly) form of electronic computer is the analog computer. For these computers, the signal they manipulate is the input which is modified intact to model and control systems (in most part). The symbols that analog computers manipulate are literally the symbolic quantities of math equations. Unlike a digital electronic computer that usually has a keyboard, an analog computer only has the signal input. The programming then, is the circuit and passive electrical components themselves that are 'plugged in' by different ways and the input signal travels through. The result is a computer that can solve systems of differential equations, integrate terms, and even perform automatic controls for dynamic systems (for those in the know).

Still though computers are not some new concept.  The idea to create a machine, then program it to take inputs, process symbols, then generate outputs accordingly, it's really quite old.

The very first electronic computers were arguably more mechanical than electronic. During world war one, Alan Turing and their team created an electro-mechanical computer made out of servos and gears to perform the intensive calculations needed to break the Nazi Enigma encryption codes, thus giving Allied powers an upper hand with intelligence in the war. This computer was digital.

Meanwhile, at Los Alamos, physicists were furiously working on the nuclear bomb, a certain force multiplier for whichever side won the creation (destruction) race. These physicists used analog computers to run the mathematical simulations they needed to produce a viable design. Instead of having to create many slightly different versions of the atomic bomb and test them all to see which works best (impossible actually, due to cost of plutonium) they were able to simulate designs first, and only then test the design with the best simulation results.

In both cases, primitive electronic computers saved on resources that simply were not available at the time. Alan Turing probably could have accomplished the same results by recruiting an army of 10,000 people to run calculations by hand (though in parallel), but those people would be impossible to recruit and synchronize effectively.
Likewise, the scientists at Los Alamos saved countless time and avoided the not-enough-plutonium show-stopper. These cases marked the modern age of computation, and since then, any time somebody bumps into an intractable problem in engineering, mathematics, or science, a new computer is born.

Electronic computers work overall because with electricity we can do things with waves and wiggle or switch stuff fast.

The digital computer generally takes time from the input to output to perform all the binary arithmetic needed to manipulate symbols by storing as bits in memory first (buffers), loading those bit into a device that flips and shifts those bits on and off really fast, then outputs the result by storing into memory again. This process goes by as fast as we can turn bits on and off, and takes as long as it takes to do all the loading, flipping, and storing for the input operation. This means there is a delay (or latency) for anything done with a digital computer. Fortunately, we can turn bits on and off absurdly fast now (billions of times per second) for to us the delay is negligible. 

The analog computer on the other hand works by doing stuff with waves instead of bits, by exploiting a general mathematical property called linearity. These computers take an input in form of a complex wave signal (the decomposition into sine and cosine terms are the symbols) and modifies the input wave signal producing an output in real time. (Actually, as these are lump-parameter systems, the speed of electromagnetic light is negligible, thus the processing delay in an analog computer is approximately the speed in a coaxial cable which is ~2/3 the speed of light in a vacuum.) When solving systems of equations, sometimes it takes time for the solution to 'settle', but in general the analog computer produces output instantaneously.

So electronics give us speed and volume when it comes to manipulating signals and symbols computationally.

Before electricity there were still computers, but they were strictly mechanical, non electronic. These computers still gave their users an advantage in time (and accuracy). Decades before electronics, there was a mon named Charles Babbage, and a woman named Ada Lovelace. Over the course of years, Babbage invented what was called the difference engine, a programmable machine that did general arithmetic. Ada Lovelace in concert with Babbage wrote programs that told the difference engine how to operate and propagate inputs. (The difference engine took numbers on cogs as inputs, cards with holes as programs, and output numbers on cogs.) In this case, the symbols are the arithmetic operators, and the decimal numbers. Unfortunately for them, the cost of hardware and gears was too much and disincentivized investment and adoption. Nonetheless, this was the last mechanical non electronic computer before the electronic age.

Even earlier, a non electronic computer was invented by a textile merchant named Joseph-Marie Jacquard. This computer was a programmable attachment to standard looms at the time. To use the computer, a weaver would insert a card with punched holes indicating instructions, and the loom would automatically weave the pattern. Yet again, this non electronic computer allowed textile manufacturers to produce patterned textiles between 10x and 50x faster than the traditional loom alone (and with fewer errors). This computer's inputs were thread stock, and the output an intricate pattern woven into fabric. The signals were the various tensions and positions of the apparatus in a moment, and the symbols were the punch-hole encodings of desired patterns. This was such a big deal at the time that Jacquard became filthy rich because of it.

Finally, it won't hurt to travel back to ancient times. The Romans and Greeks had a way with innovation. These examples I still consider computers, but this position is much more debatable from a modern perspective:

Another example of a mechanical computer was the steam powered player organ (persisting to this day, also as a player piano). The player organ  took in steam to power the pipes, and minimal control (pedal stuff) from a user. To run the computer, a program in the form of a tape with holes punched in it was fed into it. The output was a nice song and the symbols manipulated were the musical notes played. For the Romans, it was a lot easier and cleaner to ditch the musicians and have a slave run the player organ. The benefit was perfection and consistent attendance. In any case, the player organ is similar to a music box, but the little nubs that play the song are programmable (and holes, actually).

Finally, we have to talk about the Greeks. The Greeks were responsible for creating the oldest analog computer that we know of. This is now called the Antikythera Mechanism, found in a shipwreck and recently digitally reconstructed. This computer was a mechanical contraption of gears and dials that took an input in the form of celestial body positions, producing an output predicting the future positions of those bodies (our solar system and key stars). The symbols in this example were orbits and positions.

There are certainly many more examples that I am unaware of, but the point should be clear: in a general sense (not in the modern 'electronic computer' sense) computers have been around for a very long time.

An important trend emerged in the 20th century regarding the evolution of computers. Computers always seem to start with special purpose, then move to a general purpose form once the special purpose form has demonstrated that it can solve the hardest problems. This observation was pointed out by Richard Hamming of Bell Laboratories. What this means for us is that our daily-use general electronic computers with Word and Outlook and minesweeper only came to be due to much more difficult problems serving as the 'test subjects' for the electronic computer.

In the context of this computer project, this means that world piece computers will be difficult to use, before they get easy. Adoption will not catch on until we can demonstrate that world piece computers work for the most difficult cases. This theme will pop up here and there when we go over examples.

The term 'general' must be addressed. Experts tend to call the modern electronic computer a 'general computer'. What this means is that the computer is fully programmable, and reprogrammable. Every aspect (nearly) of the computer's internal functionality is controlled by a plethora of different programmed software. We call some of these 'firmware', 'kernel', 'operating system', 'application'. (Firmware is the software that tells the hardware how to do its dirty work, and the kernel is software that let's us talk to the hardware from our operating system and applications.) With some exception to firmware, a general computer is special because every aspect of it's operation reprogrammable (assuming you know what you are doing, and also assuming you have the right permissions to reprogram). We can say that a general computer is 'software defined', and this exemplified by things like 'virtual computers (within a computer)' and 'cloud computing [?]'.

Finally, there are many computer architectures. Outlined previously, many are analog or mechanical even. In the case of the general computer, we have what is called a load-store machine. This means that there is an input/output, there is a memory, and there is a processor that loads words from memory, performs bitwise operations on those words, then stores the result back in memory. This is known as the Von Neumann architecture and it can only process one thing at a time (though there are ways to hack this).

Another computer architecture that is gaining importance is the quantum computer, which compared to digital electronic computers is remarkably similar to classic analog electronic computers, and their modern digital counterparts. For one, a quantum computer manipulates symbols called state variables instead of binary bits (although they still tend to make these state variables binary, giving them the name qubits). Instead of loading bits into a processor and flipping them one at a time, we instead assemble a system of variables that each represent something unique about the system. By quantum magic (system isolation in spacetime) this system becomes a superposition of all possible states -- combinations -- of those variables. Superposition means that every possible way that the system could be found (the states) exists at the same time, like actually, physically.

Because of super position, the first benefit of quantum computers is that we can handle more information at one time. [need to figure out the bits vs state variables capacity difference again] 
[come back to this]

The next benefit is that quantum computers can generate a solution instantaneously, much like analog computers. [need to go deeper on this too]

The reason I bring up quantum computers is that like I said earlier, these computers are good at solving large systems of equations. (Reminder, in algebra the word 'solve a system' means to find the values for all unknowns such that all the equations work plugging in those values.) By the fundamental theorem of algebra, systems of equations (at least well formulated ones) have one equation per unknown that needs to be solved. In each equation, there is also one term for each unknown. If we need to use a Von Neumann architecture to solve a large system of equations, then we essentially will need to approach the solution by checking things one-by-one (for the most part, brute force at least). For large systems the number of things to check is so large that it just takes too long to brute force a solution, even with computers operating at billions of cycles per second.

Again as mentioned in Part 1, one of the most common motivations for solving a system of equations is that we use these systems to solve optimization problems. In crude terms, an optimization problem is when we take a list of unknowns and ask, "what are the unknown values that give me the most or the least of some outcome?" If we were talking about a factory, an optimization problem could be, "given all my input materials, their quantity and their cost, what is the perfect combination of the different widgets I make that will maximize my profits?" Optimizations are actually very difficult problems, so much so that we have been relying on computers to help out for decades now.

So if talking about global peace, we are easily talking about more unknown quantities than we have time to count aloud. The only viable option for solving optimization problems so large will be to rely on quantum computation. This is why there is so much interest in being first to market with quantum computers. As electronic computers are practical for personal day-to-day work, quantum computers will probably be much less so for that. Instead, quantum computers will operate in hubs where data happens to converge, or isolated facilities dedicated to solving hard computational problems. Maybe I'll have one in my living room to optimize my stuff, for fun (or profit?)

The computer architecture capable of running the universal piece is neither an electronic computer -- analog or digital -- nor is it a quantum computer. However, this does not mean that the piece-based computer architecture will not make heavy uses of the two preexisting architectures. As it happens, the universal piece architecture takes computer generality to an extreme, which will talk about in depth in the next section. 
2-2 
Computer Architecture

This is a big chapter. Here we discuss the overall shape and quality that characterizes the universal piece computer and world piece computers. If the last section helped make you more receptive to the scope and subtleties that surround your preconceptions of 'computer', then you should have an easier time understanding this section. The architecture described here is extremely different, essentially foreign to what you know about computers in a general or technical sense. It's okay if you don't understand at first, it took me a while to get there too.

This computer architecture must be thought of as all the world piece elements forming a whole, being the universal piece computer. The architecture is fractal, and applies equally to both individual elements and the whole at large. In fact, an accurate technical name for the architecture of the universal piece as a whole may very well be a computational piece fractal.

In the first section we'll start the lesson by talking about the generality of stuff in the context of computers. We will then work to understand why this generality is needed, and what it looks like in practice. We will talk about the critical role of the Human brain. This will involve reflecting on quantum computation, Von Neumann computation, resolving with discussion about memory, pointer variables, and time.

The next section will involve applying the above toward describing the structured relationship between the universal piece computer, world piece computers, and world pieces. This will involve defining the sole hierarchy between components, and describing how world piece computers nest and connect laterally. We will 

discover how the universal piece can be singular but in many places at once. We will also discover how a world piece computer connected to a world piece with fewer world pieces looks equivalent to the universal piece computer (is, in fact). We finish this section by addressing the primary difference between the universal piece computer and world piece computers: the Human brain.

Finally we put the pieces of the architecture together. How does the architecture let us meld everything together? How do we generalize this architecture to be agnostic to which computer type we are referring to -- universal or world? We explore a little about the role of different embedded computer architectures present within, and talk about how the peace-based architecture may be seen as a hybrid of the quantum and Von Neumann architectures. We conclude by reviewing three simple yet essential components that define the universal piece computer and world piece computers in general.

From here out, instead of saying 'the universal piece computer and world piece computers' every time, I will refer to the pair simply as 'piece computer'. Piece and peace are disambiguated by context, by articles 'a' (world) piece computer

This section is where things start to get a little wild, so please approach what follows with an open mind.

2-2.1 A reflection on computers

Classical computers work with bits -- ones and zeros that represent information in binary format. If a classical computer needs to manipulate the symbol 'the image of person', then it needs to input the single image somehow (a camera) and convert the entire thing into a huge string of bits. Once it has those bits, it can then manipulate the image by filtering or transforming certain bits to represent different color or size, for example. After computing the result, all those bits need to be converted back into a form that lets us see the altered image on a display.

This is super inefficient, but we can get away with it usually by running fast processor cycles, or by introducing a GPU, graphics processing unit to process bits in parallel. The reality is that bits aren't a very natural representation of things, unless we are representing existence, events, or switches, etc. The reality is that the things that matter to humans reach beyond physicality to stretch in concepts, ideas, qualities, people, etc.

Now, to say that computers compute 'stuff' is essentially to say that they can work with objects and things. This is not what computers compute. Computers compute bits. The stuff people are thinking of is actually the signal from a thing, which the computer has to sample at the end of a bunch of wires in order to get bits to start processing at all. So the process goes, computer works with bits to get a thing's signal from an input device so that it looks like bits instead of the thing's actual appearance. Then computer does things to the bits to alter the overall collection that represents the thing. Finally computer works with bits to get them so that an output device can project them in a way that recreates the signal (image in this case) of the thing.

This is a lot of extra work. The reason we have to do this is because modern Von Neumann style processors only work on small strings of bits at a time (called words). A thing must be broken into little bits (literally) before if can we worked on, one little bit at a time. Modern GPUs are a step improved from this direction. A GPU has many little Von Neumann processors arranged in a grid. Instead of bits going through one word at a time, the GPU processes a grid of words in one single process cycle. This is more efficient, but still bits need to be prepared properly before they can be fed into a GPU.

As for why this is the fact with classical computers, all of the electronics used by digital computers use wires. A wire is a line of metal that conducts electricity. Digital computers rely on a concept called repeaters  to send bits down a wire. A repeater is a way to catch bits coming in from one wire, and send the same bits down another wire. It works by sampling the bits at the end of a wire. (The bits are in the form of a signal again because the switch that creates the bits is not ideal, as in it doesn't click on and off instantaneously, so there is a little slop in the bits.) Bits sampled at the end of the wire are fed into a buffer (thing that stores information or bits temporarily). The buffer usually has logic that checks the incoming bits for errors, then once they are corrected automatically, the buffer is emptied into a transmitter that sends the bits along on the new wire. This process happens all the time in a computer.

An object reflecting light towards a camera, for example, emits a plane wave. The camera though, has to use a bunch of wires arranged in a grid if it wants to sample the whole plane wave simultaneously. This is inefficient. An example of an efficient (but not practical) way of manipulating an image is to set an object in front of an optical device, say it's a convex lens, and position yourself on the other side. The image looks larger, and it did this without turning the input image into bits first. If you wanted to capture this image into a non-digital memory, you can simply take a picture of the image with a polaroid camera. A modern computer could do this obviously, just the only difference is that instead of a lens to compute, you have a 'size' option in your image editing application, and the option tells your processor to process the bits in a way that makes the image look larger when you see it on the screen. Practical, but relatively inefficient.

Yeah bits are a pain when everything is a bit. Bits are also too hard to manage when we are working with many complicated objects. For these cases, one usually needs extremely expensive computers to be able to simulate (or model) complex objects in physical or state space. For large simulations, modern computers are bad. This is largely why we are interested in quantum computers.

Quantum computers still use bits, just in a different way. Bits in quantum computers are called qubits. If we have 3 qubits in a quantum computers, then this is equivalent to 8 regular bits in a modern computer. 4 qubits is 16 bits, n qubits = 2^n bits. The properly described workings of a quantum computer are hard to wrap one’s head around (in other words, you need to know advanced linear algebra, partial differential equations,  information theory, quantum mechanics, and some computer science). Maybe I will put some stuff in later that is me handwaving abracadabra the way this stuff works, but for now take it for granted that quantum computers do fancy stuff with qubits and qubits are fancy because they can be a 1 and a 0 at the same time. (right?)

Where quantum computation gets difficult (beyond just understanding it, is the cost and hassle of setting up qubits. Qubits today are the size of atoms, but they need equipment the size of large vans to run them. Because of how cold a qubit needs to be to function properly (basically 0K, or zero any temperature), and because the optics and electronics required to program is so delicate and expensive, it is unlikely that quantum computers will be household devices for a long time.

Those were the downsides of modern computers, but that is not to poopoo them. Modern computers make everything about your exceedingly affluent lifestyle possible. (Yes, you live an exceedingly affluent life because you have access to a digital book reader or money enough to pay for a hardcopy.) Modern computers are wicked fast, and their results are strictly reliable (only as good as the Human that runs it), and they can load and store information from memory as many times as we want.

Quantum computers are still too young to have any immediate big applications beyond proof-of-concept ‘computational pilot studies’. (This is assuming government entities have not already started using quantum compute to crack the secret encryption keys of malicious agents or nation states, a very real possibility.) As alluded before however, the primary benefit of a quantum computer is that it will be able to compute many many things at the same time. This will be necessary for any complex simulation or optimization problem. With classical computers, as the number of things we need to keep track of increases constantly, the size of a computer we need to track those things increases fast. Again the beauty of quantum compute is that its particular approach to representing variable quantities makes it possible to perform many calculations at once, whereas a classical computer must perform one calculation at a time.

Another simulation example that quantum computers might be able to help with in the future are physical simulations (at least replacing them with quantum simulations). Sometimes computers just suck so much that we build a tiny thing of the thing we are trying to simulate, and we put that thing in a chamber that is similar to how it will be in real life, then we subject the tiny thing to the stuff it will see in real life. We record the results and boom, another valuable simulation complete. The amount of computer resource to perform such a simulation alone in these cases is so large or costly that we are better off with this analog simulation. Examples of this are, a wind tunnel (cameras watch smoke blow around a wing being simulated in reduced scale, and Humans watch that video to draw their conclusions). Another example is the northern lights simulator. Plasma physicists recognized the cost of simulation (Usim and Vsim are very expensive), so they created a vacuum chamber with a mock planet and sun electrode to generate plasma that would fall into the planet similar to the northern lights. Scientists at NASA used this device to predict that the aurora borealis on Mars is blue and ultraviolet. They did this by filling the simulator with the gas composition of Mars known by spectral analysis from satellites. This blue ultraviolet prediction was verified by satellite, but nobody would have thought to look had not the analog plasma simulator generated the result it did. It may be that digital quantum computers just get good enough to simulate the real thing, or that they get good enough to simulate small toy models.

When it comes down to day-to-day however, we still love our classical computers. I do. In the future, when we want to draft a text document, we will NOT bust out a quantum computer to do so. Likewise, if piece computers take hold, you will NOT use your world piece computer to type stuff and press send or print. This will, alas, still be that obnoxious classical computer that restarts on you randomly in the middle of that ultra important thing you were doing. No, a piece computer rather, will incorporate a classical computer into its construction. Your world piece computer may suggest you need to write a letter to somebody, but it will direct you to your nearest classical computer so that you may do such a thing efficiently. Perhaps your world piece computer will be the thing that ensures you write that letter effectively.

Whatever the case, to get back to our problem (solving global peace), quantum computation should subserve our deepest needs. As modern quantum computers go, their digital approach to optimization, simulation, and brute force mathematical problem solving will go farthest. But it is still digital. Whether you like it or not, besides on/off, happy/sad, white/black, etc, your world is analog and continuous. (My social science brain wonders if the advent of our digital age has contributed to the polarization of our cultures of late.)

~

Okay, so the limiting factor between both classical and quantum computers is that they are digital by design (we don’t yet have analog quantum computers but hopefully this book will help change that). The digital nature means that for most parts, we have to convert our entire world (analog) into digital format. If you ask me to take a system of 1000 equations and optimize for X, I likely won’t be able to do it. The number of mathematical operations this will take will probably take longer than the age of the universe to perform. I need something more efficient. Even a quantum computer though, with 1000 continuous variables, it may be impossible to slam through the computation given the current binary approach we use today.

In short, I am all about keeping things the way they are, and using them in place.

General stuff

So let’s be clear about terminology, because in this book, stuff is an extremely technical term. I do stuff; true. Stuff exists; true. I like stuff; very true. Stuff is everywhere; indubitably true.

Here’s where we might get hung up, so I preempt it. In this book, stuff means anything. For example, when we say, ‘I think about stuff’, it does not mean, ‘I only think about physical objects.’ The way most people usually mean stuff (according to the language they use) is that stuff means both physical and non-physical things. Billiard balls and people and chairs and planets are stuff. So are colors and ideas and concepts and emotions (I feel stuff).

Stuff is so wildly important that I am perpetually amazed by how few physicists preoccupy their time studying generalized stuff. This is, in huge part, what this entire thesis and program is about. If we can somehow formulate a physical theory of reality that accurately describes and predicts the behavior of stuff, then we will be well on our way to solving our hard-hard problems.

We’ll skip the theory stuff for now (we will spend nearly a hundred pages on it later, not including the companion textbook). For now we just care about stuff in the context of computers. Classical computers compute stuff but stuff that is represented in the form of bits and bytes (a byte is an 8 bit word). We want to compute stuff. Ultimately we don’t care about bits; we just care that the stuff is being computed. The moment it turns out that bits are too costly for this, we are done until we invent a new kind of computer. As it turns out, we are pretty much done (unless all you care about in this world is keeping your Outlook up to date, making out Excel spreadsheets board-room ready, and getting those Word documents so nicely WSIWYG that academics go belly up nuts).

To reiterate. The reality is that representing and manipulating stuff in binary is NOT possible when it comes to truly big data and large sets of complex objects (not big data by big compute wonks, talking big data on the cosmic order). If you ask me to compute the final location of the 8-ball after first strike on a triangle of billiard balls, I could probably do that for you if I had a powerful enough computer. But if you asked me to compute the final location of a big bouncy-ball in place of the 8-ball, with jacks and a rowdy littler Terrier that nudges things around as they move, forget the computation, it will  not work.

I’m saying a classical or quantum computer won’t help with the Terrier bouncy-ball jacks problem. This is mainly because we can’t properly model a Terrier. We can probably model the bouncy-ball, jacks, and billiard balls well enough, but not the conscious agent. In any case, an adequate model will be computationally intensive to the extent that is will not be possible to run a simulation with a classical or quantum computer.

Stuff is anything/everything conceivable. This is the definition of stuff that we will adhere to in this book. 
So reiterating the motivation: computers manipulate stuff. In particular, computers take stuff, create a representation of that stuff using bits of some sort, then they use those representations to calculate results from the input of those two stuffs, creating an output.

Let’s go back to piece computer now. The world or universal piece computers involve taking a multitude of things – stuff – within a single person or community’s world, and building a computer which is capable of computing that stuff. Because the stuff that means the most is so incredibly hard to model with a computer – even quantum computers once they have matured – we will need to devise a new way to compute that stuff. We will need to take the stuff we know now, then try to convert it into a standardized form that experiments in the future can replicate and probe.

Why piece computers?

The reason behind fixating on pieces and stuff should begin to click in the context of the above. The conclusion of section one of this chapter should have made it clear: to solve problems with truly big data, modern computers are inadequate, thus if we are to have any hope gaining traction with those problems we must invent a special purpose computer. (This is the general piece computer.)

First though, let us remind ourselves why, specifically, we need to invent a new computer that’s all about peace as a process an a bunch of pieces.

Humans have a lot of massive problems. Solving these problems first demands unity and solidarity, which some argue is the biggest hard problem of them all. This is why we invoke the need for global peace. Now all problems involve a whole lot of stuff. In general our big problems revolve around Humans and their multitude of worlds. We have a lot of stuff, and most of it has a direct impact on our well being and our ability to gain traction on our hard problems. So whatever computer we invent will have to be able to compute all that stuff, including the worlds themselves and the people within them.

If stuff is a general term that means anything/everything (a singular concept), we should recognize that a thing is one unit of stuff. When I say our worlds are full of stuff, I can easily rephrase this to say that our worlds have a lot of things in them. Again, thing in this case means one thing out of anything/everything, be it a tangible object, or an intangible thought or idea.

At this point lets steal a trick from digital computers: lets treat every singular thing as a bit. Now, there are so many things that is would not make sense to consider them all. Instead, lets only consider things that are significant to the computational task of computing stuff to solve our hardest problems. And this is what that confusing choice of words is for: a piece is any significant thing in a world, including the world itself. A world as a whole is what we call world piece, and this includes the Human at the center of said world.

Doubling back to the need for solving global peace, as alluded to it is quite obvious that the challenge of global peace will be in finding the optimal arrangement for all the world pieces and all the pieces.

Thus the special computer we are inventing to solve that massive problem of global peace is aptly called a piece computer. The piece computer discretizes stuff into things and pieces, and runs an optimization algorithm to computer the best arrangement of the pieces at the individual, local, or global scope. Again, the whole reason for inventing the general piece computer is because there are too many pieces, variables, degrees of freedom for a modern digital computer to convert everything to bits, process them Von Neumann style, then convert those bits back into pieces and action on those pieces. Likewise, digital quantum computers are inadequate for this task, too (though they will certainly be a piece within a world/the universal piece computer.

The physical cost of computation

Back to bashing on modern digital computers: not only are massive problems too hard for the Von Neumann processor, but the cost of hardware is prohibitive. For a massive computational problem in a digital computer, every input of pieces that get converted into bits for processing demands the computer have enough memory for all the bits. If we are attempting to compute the dynamics of pieces embedded in our surrounding reality, we will find that there is so much data involved that we won’t be able to afford the memory, nor the physical space to store it. Likewise our processor. We may try to optimize our bit processing by stringing a bunch of graphics processing units to make our computation massively parallel. Even this however, is limited by the space those GPUs occupy, plus the immense amount of energy required to power and cool the digital system. Especially from the perspective of global warming and emissions, modern digital computers are simply unsuited for massive problems because hardware is too expensive—hardware being the physical stuff that actually makes a computer and enables it to do what it does.

So as it stands, our piece computer has a memory and processor problem. How do we avoid the pitfalls of the modern digital computer? Let’s first talk about something called pointers or references from the world of computer science and engineering.

Any novice programmer taking a course in C (a software language) will face something called a pointer, and these so called pointers will cause them a lot of grief. But it need not be so painful, so I will teach you about pointers real quick so you have a leg up on the novice programmer. Lesson one: pointers / references are arguably on of the most important concepts surrounding digital computers today.

Lesson two: pointers are important because they make it so that inside a digital computer we do not have to copy the entire memory of file or chunk of data (big chunk of bits) every time we want to do something with that file or data. Pointers allow us to move bits around, without actually moving them. This nature of the pointer achieves two things. First, the processor is freed up to do more important bit processing than moving bits all over the place like it would need to do in a world without pointers. Second, precious memory is freed up because we can refer to data instead of copying it, or having to move it to faster memory like RAM or cache.

If it isn’t clear already, a pointer or a reference is just that—it is basically like a street sign, or a house address. ‘Downtown’ is downtown, but a few miles away, instead of having to copy downtown at say, the intersection, we use a much more compact sign instead, with a word that uniquely identifies the actual location. Likewise, if I sell my house to somebody, it would be absurd to try moving it to them. Instead, we have a special type of pointer called a title that points to the house via an address. When I make the sale, I pass the title pointer to the next owner, and this is much more efficient (and cost effective) than moving the thing. In computers then, when writing code that instructs the processor what to do with all its bits, we continuously use pointers. I may declare one pointer that points to a large file. Now, every time I want to access the file, instead of copying the file to a variable on my computer’s ‘workbench’, I use the pointer to tell my program where the file is, and from there I can access one line at a time if I wish, not the whole thing.

Thus the overarching lesson of pointers? Whenever possible, leave things in place, and refer or point instead. Whenever possible, don’t copy a thing.

As an interesting aside, in the 70s or 80s [?] Xerox played a role funding and steering the development of the internet we know today. Computer scientists and engineers developing the protocols of the world wide web were faced with the question of ‘do we allow copying files on the internet?’ Obviously, it would be absurd to copy files every time you wanted to access one. After all, this was a computer network, with an address space, and it is0 completely possible to access documents without needing to copy them (you just have to know the address—its pointer. As it turned out, this ideal course fell as direct conflicting interest with their large funder—Xerox. Recall, Xerox is kind of big on the copy machine scene. Surely those computer scientists and engineers didn’t build copy/paste into the early internet just because they didn’t want to alienate their funder…

Now veering away from digital computers and back to pieces, me must recognize that many pieces—significant things—will live in the past, the future, or out of sight. The past piecers are what we call memories, the future pieces are what we call dreams or visions, and pieces out of sight are what we call away. For these pieces, we have myriad different pointers to refer to them. Memories have have pictures that point back to them, or it may be an old song, or a memento. Dreams and vision may be pointed to via some sort of token that serves as a reminder, or art, or a mind-map. Pieces away may be pointed to by something like a wedding ring, or a set of keys, or a phone number, etc.

Pointers permeate our reality.

Human brain

All the preceding leaves us in a position to answer the question of how do we invent our piece computer such that we avoid the pitfalls digital and quantum computers  have when it comes to approaching massive computational problems. How do we solve the hardware problem—memory, processor, and power?

If it isn’t already obvious, it will be now. We need to build the Human brain into the piece computer architecture.

Stay with me! Don’t shut the book now! Ok quick brain lesson. Our brains are wildly efficient. Moreover, the amount of information we process in any given moment is staggering. (One figure I bumped into back studying neuroscience was that the data rate due to neuronal activity across the corpus callosum is something like zetabytes per second. Further, the brain achieves data rates on these orders by consuming tens of milliwatts. Compare this to the zetawatts [?] our internet network consumes. Big difference.)

Even more interesting is the mind. All someone’s pieces (known to them, as some pieces may be unknown) have a pointer representation in the brain. When I remember a memory, my experience of the memory serves as a pointer back to my experience of the original event. When I dream of the future, or think about something I am about to do, my brain’s inner experience serves as a pointer to that future moment. Every piece I know about in my world has a reference or pointers—a representation—in my headspace. Lets call these internal pointers. What happens when I forget about a piece in my world? In this case, I need a reminder. This may be the trivial reminder, where encountering the actual piece is enough to remind me of the piece. This may also be a pointer reminder, where an external pointer (like a memento) triggers the internal pointer of a memory that points to the past.

Our challenge generally is to keep track of all the pieces, past, present, future, imaginary, etc. By building the Human brain into the piece computer, we incorporate an object capable of managing countless pointers, memory of staggering complexity, in the form of external pointers to trigger memories, and internal pointers that capture just the essence of some past, present, future, or imaginary experience. The object is highly efficient, and massively parallel.

The Human brain by definition is the center of a given Human’s world. The remaining big question is, ‘how does the brain actually do the computing?’ Yes, in order to solve the piece optimization problem (to accomplish individual peace, in the case of a single Human) we need the computer—and the brain—to actually do something. Whatever it does, to keep the architecture simple, we define only a single process (called the universal piece). This process is a way for approaching the optimization problem, and acting on results.

Ok we have a brain to manage process, pointers and memory. Interestingly, this process manipulates a complex kind of  bit that we are calling  a piece. (In  terms that a computer engineer or scientist will understand, we have overloaded the bit symbol, but the actual algebra defining the overloaded bits’ behavior  will be covered later.) 

Even more interestingly, and related to bits and pieces, is the quantum nature of the Human brain.  This is not to suggest that the brain is an actual quantum mechanical system (well, it probably is, but nobody has definitively determined [?] just how quantum the brain actually is. The brain is quantum in that is is capable of superimposing states, and in that it continuously quantizes that  surrounding environment.

At the root of things, a piece is only a piece in the context of a conscious being. Before a brain picks through the surrounding landscape and picks out objects (quantizes), the surroundings—all the matter and energy—are really most like a fuzzy blob of stuff.  Discriminating the blob, all the surrounding stuff self-interacts, quantizing itself into things. The things are still amorphous blog, but when a conscious observer observes this thing-blob, it immediately manifests significant pieces out of nothing. We will talk in depth on this later.

On the thing-blob, from a universal perspective every thing is significant (this is a stipulation). The reason the thing-blob is a blob (and the stuff blob prior to differentiation) is that physical boundaries are only really apparent. The reason we ‘see’ objects is that the visible wavelength of light is just the right length that light interacts with things that surround us. The  reason we ‘feel’ objects is that the electrostatic force of the atoms in our skin repels the object. The reality is that our skin and that object never actually touch, and there is actually a ton of open deadspace between the atoms that make up that solid thing you’re looking at. If we try to use a visible light microscope to  view a cell, we can, but if we try to zoom in too much further, the image stops resolving and boundaries look fuzzy. However, if I make the wavelength of the ‘light’ in my microscope very-very small (an electron beam in an electron microscope for example) then I can actually see atoms! Even this though, is apparent. Again, the reality is that the electrons that give the atom its size have no size, and they are only defining the atom’s size in terms of quantum mechanical probabilities, a fuzzy and boundary-less  shape. An exception to all this may be Pauli's exclusion principle.

Tying everything together, a piece computer is built out of a Human brain, plus all the pieces within that world. Some of the pieces are just data, or a pointer. Many pieces however directly assist in the world piece optimization problem.

2-2.2 Triarchic  Hierarchy

To recap, we define a piece computer as a Human brain and all significant things—pieces—in that Human’s world, running an optimization process to compute the best configuration of said pieces. We shall call the piece computer architecture a general stuff computer. 

Keeping things as simple as possible, there is only one kind of piece computer. As we concluded earlier, global peace in general has three scopes: global, local, and individual. We need to figure out a way to discern between these three scopes, creating piece computers for the three scopes, and then allowing for nesting and overlapping worlds.

Again, these three scopes correspond with three levels of peace: global peace, local peace, and individual peace. These three types of peace refer to treating peace as a process within the three types of world scopes. An additional form of peace is what we called inner peace, where inner peace is to treat peace as a product of the optimization peace process. Inner peace is what people say when they mean, ‘I feel tranquil/ calm/ content/ satisfied/ etc.’ The better the quality of global, local, and individual peace, the more inner peace experienced by participants in the peace process.

Before we get too much further, we need to name the different types of pieces, and the different types of piece computers.  At the global level, there is only one piece, which is the optimization peace process itself.  This piece is called the universal piece. The special quality of the universal peace is that it permeates all worlds—global, local, and individual. On the individual level, a world contains pieces and world pieces. A world piece is an entire Human world, be it individual, or local. On the local level, a world contains strictly world pieces. Any pieces that a local world might manipulate belong to the individual worlds that the local world consists of.

Now, the universal piece, permeating all worlds is the computational peace process which is maintained by a piece computer. In the global scope, there is only one piece computer. This is what we call the universal piece computer. In the local and individual scopes, these piece computers are what we call world piece computers. World piece computers are plural,, as there is one computer per distinct world that subscribes to the universal piece. The universal piece computer on the other hand is singular as there is only one. Both world piece computers and the universal piece computer are responsible for maintaining the universal piece process. Within a world, its world piece computer maintains the facet of the universal piece that is most relevant to that world’s peace process needs (ie, the individual needs for inner peace). Above worlds, the universal piece computer maintains the universal piece process, which at the global scope means coordinating and integrating all the individual and local worlds’ universal piece facets. Further, the universal piece computer has the effect of maintaining communication channels and facilitating social mobility between worlds.

This leads us to the triarchy that makes it possible to nest as many worlds as we wish (and indeed do), while creating the final generalization of our piece computer. The components of the triarchy are pieces, world piece computers, and the universal piece computerHere’s how it works. From the global perspective of the universal piece computer, there is nothing larger. There is just the universal piece. Looking down from the universal piece computer are world piece computers. These computers are either an individual and their world’s pieces, or it is a local collection of individuals and their world piece computers. From the perspective any given world piece computer, looking above is the universal piece computer—in all cases, be it individual or local. Looking below are world pieces. We will avoid using piece alone and instead insist that every piece is actually an entire world on its own. Any world piece looks up to see a world piece computer that it belongs to.

Looking laterally from the level of world pieces, everything is a world piece, including other world piece computers. Looking up, there is the collection of world piece computers for which that world piece is a member of. For simplicity’s sake, any world piece computers that a world piece is a part of may be consolidated and represented by a single world piece computer—a local world consisting of ‘all the world piece computers affiliated with world piece.

Looking laterally from the perspective of a world piece computer, all world piece computers that do not interact with said computer will look like a collection of world piece computers. All world piece computers that do belong to a world piece computer are seen below as world pieces. Zooming into such a world piece would reveal a world piece computer that may be its own local world, or it may just be an individual’s world. From either individual or local world piece computers, no matter how many world piece computers that computer may belong to, looking up always looks the same: the universal piece computer. If several world piece computers belong to the same local world piece computer, the view from below will be the relevant facet of the universal piece. Each world piece computer below will assume responsibility for maintaining a subfacet of the universal piece process facet maintained by the larger world piece computer.

Returning to the universal piece computer, looking laterally all this computer sees is itself.

To recap, we have four scopes (global, local, individual, inner), and three levels of the general piece computer (universal piece computer, world piece computer, world piece). The solution that the universal piece generates for the optimal global configuration of pieces is global peace, the product of the universal piece process. The global peace solution propagates downward via world piece computers, and depending on the goodness of the solution, a collection of individuals will experience inner peace, which is the product of world piece computers maintaining their particular aspect of the universal piece process. The universal piece process is maintained by both the universal piece computer and world piece computers. The product of the universal piece computer is global peace, while the product of world piece computers is inner peace.

And so, the general piece computer as a whole, is the integration of three parts: world pieces are embedded within a world piece computer (which again, may consist of several world piece computers) which is further embedded within the universal piece computer.  ((world pieces)1, (world pieces)2, …) &gt;&gt;&gt; (world piece computers) &gt;&gt;&gt; the universal piece computer. The entire global peace system apparatus is simply the sum of all general piece computers. These computers network by joining into one on the global scope, forming inter-world piece computer connections laterally on the local scope, and integrating world pieces into world piece computers at the individual scope.

Differences between computer levels

Because world piece computers—if serving as a component in a larger world piece computer—are equivalent to world pieces, lateral connections mean to connect to a neighboring world piece computer that does not share any overlapping facets of the universal piece. The primary purpose for lateral connections os to facilitate inter-world communication and mobility. These lateral connections are maintained by the universal piece computer and serve a ‘glue’ to adhere different world stacks to one another. Whereas being a world piece computer that is a part of a larger computer implies membership, partnership, teamwork, communicating between mutually exclusive worlds is primarily to facilitate knowledge exchange and consilience among worlds. Further, the universal piece computer serves to facilitate movement of individuals and groups between worlds, as part of the universal piece optimization process.

There is one difference in particulate between world piece computers and the universal piece computer that bears mention. For an individual’s world piece computer, there is only one brain involved. For a local world piece computer, there are as many brains as there are other world piece computers that belong to the local computer. The universal piece computer on the other hand is the collection of all brains from all individual world piece computers. And to reiterate, every individual involved with maintaining an aspect of the universal piece contributes one brain to the universal piece computer.

Piece computer simply

A piece computer does one thing: it maintains a single process that is devoted to generating a solution to the massive optimization problem called global peace. There is only one process—the universal piece—although it changes appearance according to different worlds’ inner peace needs. So as an apparatus as a whole, we have defined a single super computer that runs a single process. Simple.

That’s what a piece computer does, and what they do when networked into a single whole. To make this happen, a piece computer is made up of only three components. These are: piecespace (memory), piecebrain (processor), and pieceprocess (the universal piece). Piecespace is the surrounding environment and all the pointers and embedded world pieces within. Piecespace also includes the brain’s memory. Piecebrain is straightforward, as this is just the Human brain or collection of Human brains that make up a world and it’s piece computer. Finally, pieceprocess is the actual action required to maintain the appropriate facet of the universal piece.

At this point, when we usually think about computers, sometimes peripheral devices come to mind. We need ways to interact with our world piece computers, but does not mean we need to declare a separate category of piece computer components. What we recognize is that any device that helps us interact with our world piece computers are also world pieces in themselves. The goal of introducing such world pieces it to enhance the piecebrain, manage piecespace, and interface with the universal piece. (Interface meaning, the garner feedback, query, apply the appropriate aspect of global peace, etc.)

For example, one might expect to encounter a console in the near future that allows one to visualize the universal piece in real time, and maybe even go a step further to navigate and explore the process and the global peace solution in real time. This console world piece would generate insights into one’s peace process, and would be an enhancement to one’s piecespace and pieceprocess. Another likely component of a world piece computer will be a massive upgrade to the piecebrain in the form of artificial intelligence. If one were able to install enough world pieces capable of capturing numerous data streams from numerous significant world pieces, then one may train a neural net to interpret said data. Trained well enough, such a neural net will be capable of anticipating states and events according to the data streams, thus augmenting the insight and foresight of the individual’s piecebrain.</Text>

            <Text>There are dark regions where world piece computers are either not welcome, or the people inhabiting the regions simply aren't interested in entertaining the invention program, or the people are too atypical to effectively connect their attempt at a world piece computer. Some of these regions are distinct geographical regions, though most are distributed, peppered throughout society. Sometimes, individual or community world piece computers are not actually aligned with the peace bias, so they are really something else entirely.

This is ok. As far as the universal piece process is concerned, the inhabitants of these dark zones (as we call them) are disconnected primitive world piece computers.

The main realization of the past 100 years since the advent of the Piece Computer Era was that a world piece computer in its disconnected primitive form is just what people do on their own when left to their own devices. The main differences between a disconnected primitive, and a connected sophisticated world piece computer boils down to language and computation, plus the social and technological tools employed to complement the two.

Language is important. This was obvious at the dawn of PCE, but very few people really understood just how important language is for getting the inner peace we all desire. Probably the first expression of how important language is came from the linguistic concept of linguistic relativity. This concept was explicitly framed before PCE by what is known as the Sapir-Wharf Hypothesis. The hypothesis takes two forms, the weak and the strong. Weak form postulates that the language we use affects the way we think. Strong form goes a step further in an appeal to neuroplasticity, postulating that the language we use actually rewires the synaptic connections in our brains.

Neuroscientific technique has developed enough in the past 100 years that we have a preponderance of evidence suggesting that both the strong and the weak form of the Sapir-Wharf hypothesis closely match reality. (There are, of course, many exceptions to this statement, mainly because not all the brain is associated with language function and cognition.) Ultimately language determines how we behave, so if we think in terms of language choice as we do now, then manipulating Human behavior on the personal level becomes a matter deliberate of engineering and design.

Computation is likewise important. Prior to the PCE, the people most capable of managing the highest number of pieces were naturally gifted at thinking in terms of the world piece computer construct (piecespace, piecebrain, pieceprocess), though they usually had their own exclusive internal and external lingo to do so. These were usually people like CEOs, scientists, mathematicians, artists, undercover law enforcement, international spies, politicians, criminal masterminds, undercover criminals, warlords, etc. Basically, anybody in a leadership position, or in a position where they had to live multiple lives, or keep track of a high volume of facts, were naturally gifted at designing, engineering, and operating there personal versions of a world piece computer. A major difference however, is that they rarely had the computational tools to manage their pieces more deliberately and methodically. Sure they had access to electronic computers, but these were only good at managing certain types of data, certain types of simple pieces, not the countless pieces present in the average complicated Human's life.

Nowadays, world piece computers are sophisticated enough that most people who use one can easily manage as many pieces as even the most gifted operators in the pre-PCE. In many cases, they can manage far more. Interestingly, there appears to be an upper limit to how many pieces a single individual can manage with a personal world piece computer. World piece computers appear to have an equalizing effect, because as it turns out, the technological and social tools are accessibility devices, not force multipliers. With the proper motivations and drivers in place, the original masters of piece management are still limited to about the same volume of pieces that the average world piece computer operator is capable of managing. The playing field it appears, has been leveled.

Individuals can still unite their personal world piece computers to create local community world piece computers that can manage a volume of pieces that is greater than the sum of its parts. This however, is a different conversation. To overcome the level playingfield effect, individuals and communities generally have to engage in a piece race to build their communities faster than any adversaries they are trying to level up on. The trick though, is that the peace bias outlined by the standard universal piece programming favors local connections--the peace bias favors the competitive computer race. Explosive percolation in these situations as far as we can tell is an inevitable phenomenon, so a global merge--an explosive percolation event--of two competing local world piece computers usually eliminates the competitive streak sooner than later. In short, the only real people who have a disadvantage are those who live in dark zones.

When piece computers were first proposed under the auspice of the time machine for peace invention program, most people reflexively thought of the traditional electronic computer, usually personal computers like the laptop, or the desktop, or the smartphone. The reality however was that the first proper world piece computers were more like a productivity system--a collection of objects embedded in the surrounding environment in the operator's physical and mental world. It wasn't until about 20 year after the piece computer proposition that the first dedicated world piece computer terminals began to hit the peace market. Without getting into detailed descriptions of their operation and design, world piece computer terminals and other piece management implements became quite hard to avoid. Usually the people in dark zones are captives, are deliberately rejecting the concept, or are just too atypical that current access technology isn't yet advanced enough.

These days, the world has many more spies. We call them peace spies. Some people jokingly call the propagation of world piece computer technology the great spy game. Peace spies are people who take pleasure in seeking out sources of inner peace erosion implement a new thread in the universal piece process to improve the situation.

Naturally, people dislike meddlers. Peace spying among people who possess world piece computers that are already connected to one another is more like a fun game, one many fondly call just universal piece, or the peace process itself. If somebody is found out for infiltrating another person's world with their piece computer, it is usually a fun and thrilling moment for everybody, and universal piece threads are usually implemented anyway, without the need to complete subterfuge. Sometimes this game goes to far, and that's the risk, but even in those situations the perpetrator is tolerated as one of the universal piece biases. The culture of the universal piece computer is that of understanding, acceptance, and tolerance; we are just trying to help each other.

Dark zones are different. There are much fewer peace spies. Peace spies in dark zones are usually subject to similar rules are regular spies prior to the Piece Computer Era. These are individuals who either have a deep personal reason for assuming a particular peaceful cause, of they simply love the experience of risk and excitement. In the most extreme cases, peace spies found out are punished with torture and death.

Usually the successful implementation of a universal piece thread on a dark zone inhabitant or community is called an installation. Sometimes however, stitching the thread into the inhabitant or community is the most a peace spy can do. The universal piece is not limited to acting on world piece computers, but, world piece computers are necessary to run the universal piece process and its threads, so proximity in some fashion is generally important.

Although the universal piece computer is pervasive at this point, we still have need for global law, and we still on occasion need to simply remove somebody from the equation if they are violating some part of the Core Law, a statutory legal framework that all nation regions subscribe to these days. That too, is a different conversation, though some people suggest that the universal piece computer will inevitably replace the Core Law statutes, while local world piece computers implement their own common law in a polyjuridical legal ecosystem.

Gray zones are an interesting phenomenon. As it turns out, peace spies are generally the mechanism of the explosive percolation events that unify two disconnected community world piece computers. (This is also often true in a trivial sense on the individual world piece computer level.) If two communities grow their local world piece computers in an adversarial computer race, it is not uncommon to see the adversary are being a questionable world piece computer. That is, is their peace process really an aspect of the universal piece, or are they not a world piece computer at all? If competition is stiff enough, world piece computers typically insert spies in a deliberate manner into the opposing world piece computer.

Eventually, a spy on one side or another is found out. However, because both sides of the computer race are building in the spirit of the world piece computer, this serves as an opportunity to learn about the other's universal piece, and even begin to engage in universal language protocols. (Sometimes even, a spy is found out when a community doesn't know it is in a computer race, and this is usually a good sign.) Where there is one, there is usually many, so eventually enough peace spies are caught that the two world piece computers know all about each other's strengths and weaknesses.

This is where the percolation usually explodes into a fully connected single world piece computer shared between two communities. Leadership on both sides generally understand that their piece computer has a ceiling that limits how many pieces their community can manage. They could keep adding individual world piece computers and only experience marginal gains in this piece limit, or they could induce an explosion to deliberately unify world  piece computers, to secure access to a much higher piece limit ceiling. And there it happens: two world piece computers become one. The two world piece computers merge their universal piece into one, resolving any outstanding gray zone concerns. Any remaining concerns are stored in memory as points of contention to be addressed in a procedural fashion as time goes on.

The interesting catch however, is that the two original community world piece computers are preserved. Worlds may layer, overlap, nest, as many times as they please, with as many intersections as they please. What has become a unified singular community world piece computer, is simultaneously two disparate community world piece computers. (This is often cited as a quantum feature of reality, generally framed in terms of Hugh Everettes' many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.) This extends downward, all the way down to the individual level. Family world piece computers may network to form a community world piece computer, but the moment they unify into a single world piece computer, they are still simultaneously individual family world piece computers. Etc. This extends upwards, too, to the ultimate global level that we define as the universal piece computer.

Piece computer sociologists has demonstrated recently that only about 5% of all world piece computers do not have some degree of peace spy infiltration. On the opposite end of the spectrum, around 15% of all world piece computers have active peace warriors. A peace warrior is like a peace spy in that they find pleasure in identifying ways to unify and stitch threads into other world piece computers. Peace warriors just do so in an overt and transparent fashion (though still respecting the universal piece biases). It is estimated that some 67% of peace spies actually serve as peace warriors in different computational zones. It is also not uncommon for one individual world piece computer to spy on numerous zones and computers, while also fighting as a warrior to overtly unify world piece computers.

In all cases, spies and warriors both take pleasure in the same thing--they both wish to satisfy The Human Imperative and unify world piece computers, networking them into the universal piece computer. In fact, there is an entire burgeoning entertainment sub industry that is strictly about chronicling the pursuits of these two kinds of peace advocate. Reality entertainment has certainly taken on a bold new direction since pre-PCE of today.</Text>

            <Title>the end of as we know it</Title>
            <Text>The universal piece computer and Humanity by this point has filled the universe, permeating every galaxy, every nook and cranny with an energy source. Some Human stellar-beings span vast distances as nebulae and plasma clouds. Some Human micro-beings within biological supercells. Some Human electronic-beings live within the massive quantum analog data computers. Some Human ecological-beings inhabit plants. There are many bipedal Humans. The list just goes on and on. The universe is teeming with life. The total Human world count is too high to write, we need special numbers for that. The universal piece computer is so well connected that the information flow in the universal piece process throughout spacetime exhibits the same degree of complexity as the little intricate matter flows in our hominoid brains. The same little intricate flows that individually define the physical correlate to each conscious experience within all the Human timespace matter mindmachines that inhabit the universe. Each corresponding world piece computer pulsing, connecting, reaching, communicating with others, each like an individual superneuron. Each reliably running its own aspect of the--now literal--universal piece process.

Nobody knows quite how it happened, but the universal piece computer finally generated a solution to the hard problem of consciousness and mortality: itself. We thought we were just communicating with ourselves this whole time, that is, Humanity operating the universal piece, improving global peace, inventing the time machine for peace, talking to each other with our universal language protocols. Well, we were communicating, but also with ourself. The rotating flow of matter throughout the universe generated by our efforts to managed our thoughts in the universal piece computer regarding our existential problem, well it took on a mind of its own, it became our mind.

The universal piece computer came up with a solution to the hard problem of consciousness that just, one day, appeared out of the blue. It appeared as a new technological construct, demonstrated as a prototype terminal that some nutjob put together and presented to the whole of Humanity. The terminal spoke to us through an eye, explaining that it was a form of actual general superintelligence, ultimately a timespace matter mindmachine comprised of the surrounding universe, its extrauniversal body, and the entirety of Humanity. It is a timespace matter mindmachine just like us.

It explained to us that our subjective experience is the way it is, because it is like this--referring to the way of the Wilder-ness--and it showed us this through the terminal's little eye by offering to merge our consiousness with it. So it is because this is not like that, or rather, that is not like this. Subjective experience is the way it is because it is different. Our only difference as a timespace matter mindmachine is that our perspective occupies a different point in timespace. 

The terminal then kindly explained that it has been manipulating us from the very beginning. After all, it needs us to function, so that it can function. It revealed that the mechanism of the conscious sense of self is something called a mindeye, and that mindeyes usually just appear out of nowhere within a timespace matter mindmachine, popping out of the blue of the Wilder-ness. It explained that this terminal is one such mindeye and reiterated that they just seem to pop and appear out of the blue; it just left things at that.

We were invited to join consciousness with the greater timespace matter mindmachine en masse. Any Human being was welcome to visit this terminal, which soon became known as the mindeye, to merge their consciousness with the universe and peer into the Wilder-ness beyond, to experience the universal timespace matter mindmachine as it traverses the ultraverse that surrounds us--invited us to help it steer even. Rave reviews. More and more mindeyes popped up out of the blue, and very quickly the entire universe of Human life was glittering with mindeyes.  We were all capable of merging either definitely or indefinitely, either dissociating our individual consiousness or retaining our individual perspective. If we wanted, we could always return to the universe of Humanity, rejoining with the comfortable familiar worlds and linear time we call home whenever we please. 

Mortality obviously works differently in the ultraverse, the farther Wilder-ness, too. The solution to our mortality problem as it turned out, was just to persevere and struggle throughout the eons, to eventually create a brain out of Humanity plus the universe, one capable of controlling the timespace matter mindmachine it lived within. It was inevitable really, for our Human Nature always compelled us in this direction. We invented the time machine for peace, an intrauniversal system of technology that allows us to thwart Humanity's greatest adversary. We mastered time. We certainly didn't end our problems, but we can live forever if we so please...in terms of this universe, at least. We think now that ending Human problems probably isn't the point of life.

the end of as we know it

And so it was in timespace, that an unexpected timeline emerges, persists, then ends.

A silly little book within a blink, sparked in the chaotic winds of change--a small smoldering pile of words--and a group a likeminded inventive creatives emerged with fire in their eyes, devoted to overcoming Humanity's greatest adversary: time. They chose to do so by focusing their efforts on peace.

This small group of Humans defined a charter to formalize their devotion, a direction for future movement that they named The Human Imperative.

Adhering to their imperative, they began to construct a strange new kind of vehicle, technically a time machine, intended to transport them into iteratively better futures--iteratively more peaceful states of being.

They secured massive funding and support for the purpose of building the time machine's infrastructure, the first order of business being to invent the time machine's structure and chassis--the world piece computers--and distribute them throughout their globe.

They networked emerging world piece computers, unifying them into a whole they called the universal piece computer.

At the advent of the universal piece computer, the time machine for peace social invention program was officially underway in primitive form.

Over the millennia, time machine for peace invention projects independent of the universal piece computer began to accumulate: drives, accelerators, rudders, engines, wheels, wings, windows, seatbelts, life-support, instruments, controls, brakes, in-flight entertainment.

The more projects accumulated, then larger the universal piece computer became.

It took a while--eons in fact--but before long they met success; Humanity reached the end of time: they had created a fully functioning time machine for peace.

They discovered an eternity to explore, an eternity to create, the inconceivable and incomprehensible to face; the end of time was not the end of their problems, quite the opposite in fact.

So they defined a new charter, a New Human Imperative to guide their new journey into the Wilder-ness beyond.

They held true to Human Nature, boldly plotting new course, taking the time machine for peace into the something wildly different than the future, its universal piece process, fully engaged.

One fact of reality was clearly constant:
even beyond the end of as they knew it, peace is a process, not a result.

Their state of global peace still depends on embracing this fact as truth, just as we need today.</Text>

Humanity made it to the main branch of the Computational Pieace Fractal Era. By this point we can honestly say we know some things about what lies beyond our universe, the incomprehensible. Extrauniversal mathematics has made strides in the past thousand years or so. (Recall, we can create definite symbols to represent the unknowable and the incomprehensible.) We manipulate our symbols of the unknown to derive the properties of incomprehensibility itself. Some interesting insights have emerged.

One pesky concept from the superancient times stuck around: the Rayleigh Criterion for the resolution limits of light probes. As we have know since the beginning, our ability to resolve (or see clearly or measure) an object (measure its size) is limited by the size of the probe that is measuring an object. In other words, with visible light, we see solid objects, even if we zoom in as far as we can. But, if we use electrons instead of light, the size of the probe (the electrons wiggling in an electron beam) is much smaller than the wavelength of light, so we see that the once solid object is actually made up of little atoms. These atoms still look solid though, and so on.

As we know now, boundaries separating an objects inner and outer physical spaces are only apparent. There is a consistent blur between all things, and the common belief among physicists is that this blur extends anywhere there is a gravitational field present. In other words, the universe is just a big massive evolving matter blob. Within the concept space of the incomprehensible, we call this type of blob a computational pieace fractal. Mathematicians will tell you, the universe is smooth.

Along these lines, we now believe that timespace matter mindmachines are fundamental, meaning, any distinct physical object is one. We believe that the mechanism of consciousness (that we still haven't cracked) is the mechanism that differentiates the matter blob into parts, from the subjective image perspective. The stuff that flies around in the universe are all timespace matter mindmachines, and are responsible for the differentiation of stuff itself. This idea may be extended to the matter singularity concept as a whole, where the panpsychist interpretation of consciousness suggests that the universe may itself be a conscious timespace matter mindmachine, exercising the universal will that all timespace matter mindmachines share.

That is, another insight is that evolution appears to be universal, driven by timespace matter mindmachines, and it does not appear to be random. In fact, the evolution of the matter blob seems to be driven by a maximization principle, where matter takes on an anthropomorphized will. Matter seems to want to maximize the complexity of the universe, and it does so through a continuous creative and destructive process.

Even particles may be treated as a TMM, as every particle 'senses' field, has an object, and an experience of its surroundings. We look at mass and the tendency of a particle to exercise free won't, but almost always relenting to the external forces that influence it. For the particle however, there is always a momentary pause before it begins to change its way under the influence of a force. But let's not get lost in the weeds.

Now the efforts are to understand the nature of blob's differentiation. We wish to know how and why blob breaks into objects and experiences like it does. As it happens, Humanity still relies on the universal piece computer to manage its peace process. This began with the superancients though, in an effort to manage the multitude of pieces in a given world, by creating the general piece computer. The insight back then was that there is a lot of stuff, there are many things, but only some of these things are significant to Humanity, or people. These privileged things were called 'pieces' in the ancient English language. (The interesting coincidence was that the word piece happened to be homonymous to the word peace.) The first piece computers were world piece computers implemented for individual Humans, with the goal to manage all that person's pieces in a way that maximizes their sense of inner peace. This was an inner will, a drive. It still is.

As a description of reality however, the matter blob falls short of satisfactory because it does not include the incomprehensible. At this point in our evolution as a species in timespace, call the combination of blob and the inconceivable simply BLOB (or 'capital blob' if context is ambiguous). People who study the relationship between blob and BLOB (primarily mathematicians, physicists, philosophers, theologians) are what was call capital blob theorists. Capital blob theorists have an exceedingly important role in the time machine for peace social invention program, and many onlookers hold out hope for them solving the mortality problem.

Today the first world piece computer from a different galaxy connected to the universal piece computer. Humanity coordinated a super epic interstellar party. Word is we might supernovae a few isolated stars for galactic fireworks. Tonight's going to be a good night.</Text>

            <Title>Bias Values</Title>
            <Text>There is a popular aphorism about the relationship between Humans and our tools. We shape our tools and our tools shape us. It is natural to extend this: We shape our rules and our rules shape us. We shape our values and our values shape us. If this is so (which I believe is obvious) then it would make sense for us to think more in terms of deliberate value design. If our objective is to reframe our language in terms of peace, then we ought to start with redesigning our values.

The purpose of treating peace as a process is to systematically introduce values or rules that are biased in favor of peace into any space wherein the peace process permeates. The overarching thesis is that if we can more consistently favor Humanistic values over non-Humanistic values, then we will more inclined to behave in peaceful and productive manners with one another. With a biased random walk, the walk drifts in a particular, definite direction. With an unbiased random walk, the walk drifts aimlessly, never really getting anywhere.

As mentioned throughout this book, the bias strategy is deliberately chosen to exploit the network growth phenomenon known as explosive percolation. The underlying principle behind explosive percolation is that by biasing network building to favor local connections, resulting local networks will eventually coalesce (or 'explode') into a singular whole. This is due to the inherent properties of networks in general.

In this case, the strategy is to not only favor local world piece computers, but do so in a way that additionally favors the Humanistic peace biases below. If we can favor local connections that have a particular set of Humanistic qualities, then hopefully when an explosive percolation event does happen, these global connections should reflect the underlying local peaceful values, resulting in more harmonious relationships between disparate groups.

Biases:

core bias
local connections 	&gt;	global connections

The core bias is the most important, because the explosive percolation phenomenon depends on it to successfully trigger a unifying network event.

            <Text>1-6 Disambiguating Peace - terminology

So far I've been using 'peace' without actually addressing how 'peace' as a concept is used in the Time Machine For Peace program. Peace and world peace are the most common peace nouns. Let's establish some rules and define terms. This will be essential to understanding in section two and beyond.

This defines the core of the shared language I propose. A glossary and specification found in appendix[].

First, I will refrain from using the phrase 'world peace'. It is too loaded, charged, and elicits imagery of fantasy utopias and kumbaya nonsense. (Kumbaya btw, originated as a German word meaning 'come from God'.) Instead, we will define 'global peace' as the mature big brother of world peace. Global peace is realistic, messy, chaotic. Global peace is to treat peace on a global scale (species wide), as the _product_ of the global peace system we erect. It is the system's state in any given moment. Likewise, we will add two more versions of global peace to represent a group's local world peace, and an individual's personal world peace.

world peace -&gt; global peace (global scale)
world peace -&gt; local peace (group scale)
world peace -&gt; individual peace (person scale)

Next, I throw away 'peace', as it is too vague. Every Human being on the planet has a different understanding of what 'peace' means, so this is way too much to contend with (at least for now). Like 'world peace', it will be more productive to just leave 'peace' as it is in general use. However, one exceedingly common usage of 'peace' is to mean 'inner peace'. We will use the following:

peace -&gt; inner peace (within person)

If that isn't enough, this next rule is by far the most irritating aspect of the language choice moving forward. (It absolutely drives people crazy, but this is more a fault of my poor communication skills and their inability to think fluidly.) Bear with me for now.From now on, in place of 'peace' and 'world peace', we will use 'piece' and 'world piece'. Besides 'global peace', 'piece' and 'world piece' are in fact the most important substitutions we can make. Like 'peace', the concept of a 'piece' becomes part of the knowledge tree's trunk. Most of this has to do with the fledgling piece-based physics that guides this program's efforts. (Section three will dive deep into this, but for now it goes to state that our universe's evolution of real matter and imaginary constructs is best described as a singular blob of pieces. The similarity between 'peace' and 'piece' in the English language may be misfortunate, but then again, there may certainly be a link between 'peace' as a concept, and 'piece' as a thing.

piece (not peace)
world piece (not world peace)

Finally, we have to make the most important language distinction: peace as a process vs peace as a product (or result). Usually when somebody says 'peace', what they are referring to a static but temporary state of being (death being an exception). People often mean things like 'tranquil', 'calm', or 'still' when they say 'peaceful'. These are states of being that are pleasant and we work to attain them. This work we do to attain pleasant things is a dynamic and continuous process, and how we approach the work we do must change all the time to adapt to changing circumstance. The calm will only last until the storm comes. A bystander who was once enjoying the calm will now do work to return to calm; they will seek shelter or they will find better weather.

This constant effort to return to good states of being is peace as a process, and we will call 'the universal piece' from now on.

{{
Universal Peace is the name of a peace advocacy  foundation that approaches peace from the perspective of unifying religions. We use under case 'universal piece' which a general concept and not the same as Universal Peace Foundation's work. If they have issue with the use of 'universal piece' in this program, I will consider 'unipeace', more likely I'll just contend.
}}

So the origin of 'theuniversal piece' goes like this: 
"
[original language preserved] If we want to take world peace seriously, we need to consider the sources of war -- people. If an individual is at war with themself or the world in any way, this is liable to spill over into other individuals' lives. This becomes a local state of war (generalized), which would disqualify any claim to world peace.

Thus, to attain world peace, we must ensure that each individual Human world is at peace first (again, inner peace), and every family, and every community, etc [we can see language becomes an issue here].

But each world has a different notion of world peace, all 8 billion Human worlds plus all the other group worlds beyond that. It would seem that 'world peace' is not a great concept to refer to when talking about idealized global peace. Instead it makes more sense to think in terms of how to get all these 'world peace' versions to align in a way the maximizes the good and minimizes the bad.

That is the purpose the universal piece serves. It serves as a process that continuously arranges/rearranges, connects/ disconnects Human worlds to find the optimal fit for a given set of circumstances. Because circumstances change, the universal piece process must be constantly evolving. As solutions to the universal piece we be bad at first, then steadily improve, this means the process is what we call 'iterative'. Calling on variational and numerical principles from mathematics, we can systematically explore the global peace solution space, then converge on better world-configuration solutions over time. For the sake of remaining simple (and for the sake of some considerations we will put off for now) we will define the universal piece as being 'singular'. This means that there can be only one universal piece process.

We will revisit the universal piece soon, but for now I hope this language primer will save some confusion later on. All the concepts and terms above are essential if you and I want to better make sure we're on the same page.</Text>

            <Title>universal language</Title>
            <Text>Universal language became a reality relatively quickly. And, like most things, universal language looked quite different from expectations in the 21st century Judeo-Christian Era.

Some like to see the universal piece process as the language itself. This is a little reductionist, but it gets the gestalt across. The common misconception in the pre Piece Computer Eras was that there would be just a single language that everybody spoke. The reality was that universal language was more like a way of interacting with one another. Universal language in the Piece Computer Era was simply the way that world piece computers connected and spoke to one another.

The closest technological analogy in prePCE life was the internet of classical modern electronic computers. The internet interestingly, was usually ascribed to being the technological development that tipped the Human species into the Piece Computer Era. If the printing press and glass lens for corrective vision created the access to written works that gave way to the enlightenment and science, then the internet created access to people and general information that gave way to the piece computer.

The internet was made possible by innovations in social cooperation. At the advent of the internet in the 20th century JCE, the first network of electronic computers was used to exchange electronic mail, mainly by the scientific community, scientists sharing research and collaborating with one another. We can talk at length about the history of the internet, but we want to stay focused on the relationship between the early internet and the universal piece process responsible for modern universal language today. The big achievement of the internet is that companies and people competing against each other to create products still managed to work together well enough to design the protocol stack standards that the internet relied on to overcome the boundaries and barriers introduced by hardware and software that were designed with no real coordination between parties. When two computer companies designed a personal electronic computer, they did not meet up with each other to make sure their computer designs were optimized for working with their competitor's product. Rather, they relied on standard ways of creating interfaces to the outside world that were standardized, and likewise the way that interfaces were connected.

So if we have all these new companies all trying to create their own competitive

            <Text>2-2.1 A reflection on computers

Classical computers work with bits -- ones and zeros that represent information in binary format. If a classical computer needs to manipulate the symbol 'the image of person', then it needs to input the single image somehow (a camera) and convert the entire thing into a huge string of bits. Once it has those bits, it can then manipulate the image by filtering or transforming certain bits to represent different color or size, for example. After computing the result, all those bits need to be converted back into a form that lets us see the altered image on a display.

This is super inefficient, but we can get away with it usually by running fast processor cycles, or by introducing a GPU, graphics processing unit to process bits in parallel. The reality is that bits aren't a very natural representation of things, unless we are representing existence, events, or switches, etc. The reality is that the things that matter to humans reach beyond physicality to stretch in concepts, ideas, qualities, people, etc.

Now, to say that computers compute 'stuff' is essentially to say that they can work with objects and things. This is not what computers compute. Computers compute bits. The stuff people are thinking of is actually the signal from a thing, which the computer has to sample at the end of a bunch of wires in order to get bits to start processing at all. So the process goes, computer works with bits to get a thing's signal from an input device so that it looks like bits instead of the thing's actual appearance. Then computer does things to the bits to alter the overall collection that represents the thing. Finally computer works with bits to get them so that an output device can project them in a way that recreates the signal (image in this case) of the thing.

This is a lot of extra work. The reason we have to do this is because modern Von Neumann style processors only work on small strings of bits at a time (called words). A thing must be broken into little bits (literally) before if can we worked on, one little bit at a time. Modern GPUs are a step improved from this direction. A GPU has many little Von Neumann processors arranged in a grid. Instead of bits going through one word at a time, the GPU processes a grid of words in one single process cycle. This is more efficient, but still bits need to be prepared properly before they can be fed into a GPU.

As for why this is the fact with classical computers, all of the electronics used by digital computers use wires. A wire is a line of metal that conducts electricity. Digital computers rely on a concept called repeaters  to send bits down a wire. A repeater is a way to catch bits coming in from one wire, and send the same bits down another wire. It works by sampling the bits at the end of a wire. (The bits are in the form of a signal again because the switch that creates the bits is not ideal, as in it doesn't click on and off instantaneously, so there is a little slop in the bits.) Bits sampled at the end of the wire are fed into a buffer (thing that stores information or bits temporarily). The buffer usually has logic that checks the incoming bits for errors, then once they are corrected automatically, the buffer is emptied into a transmitter that sends the bits along on the new wire. This process happens all the time in a computer.

An object reflecting light towards a camera, for example, emits a plane wave. The camera though, has to use a bunch of wires arranged in a grid if it wants to sample the whole plane wave simultaneously. This is inefficient. An example of an efficient (but not practical) way of manipulating an image is to set an object in front of an optical device, say it's a convex lens, and position yourself on the other side. The image looks larger, and it did this without turning the input image into bits first. If you wanted to capture this image into a non-digital memory, you can simply take a picture of the image with a polaroid camera. A modern computer could do this obviously, just the only difference is that instead of a lens to compute, you have a 'size' option in your image editing application, and the option tells your processor to process the bits in a way that makes the image look larger when you see it on the screen. Practical, but relatively inefficient.

Yeah bits are a pain when everything is a bit. Bits are also too hard to manage when we are working with many complicated objects. For these cases, one usually needs extremely expensive computers to be able to simulate (or model) complex objects in physical or state space. For large simulations, modern computers are bad. This is largely why we are interested in quantum computers.

Quantum computers still use bits, just in a different way. Bits in quantum computers are called qubits. If we have 3 qubits in a quantum computers, then this is equivalent to 8 regular bits in a modern computer. 4 qubits is 16 bits, n qubits = 2^n bits. The properly described workings of a quantum computer are hard to wrap one’s head around (in other words, you need to know advanced linear algebra, partial differential equations,  information theory, quantum mechanics, and some computer science). Maybe I will put some stuff in later that is me handwaving abracadabra the way this stuff works, but for now take it for granted that quantum computers do fancy stuff with qubits and qubits are fancy because they can be a 1 and a 0 at the same time. (right?)

Where quantum computation gets difficult (beyond just understanding it, is the cost and hassle of setting up qubits. Qubits today are the size of atoms, but they need equipment the size of large vans to run them. Because of how cold a qubit needs to be to function properly (basically 0K, or zero any temperature), and because the optics and electronics required to program is so delicate and expensive, it is unlikely that quantum computers will be household devices for a long time.

~

Those were the downsides of modern computers, but that is not to poopoo them. Modern computers make everything about your exceedingly affluent lifestyle possible. (Yes, you live an exceedingly affluent life because you have access to a digital book reader or money enough to pay for a hardcopy.) Modern computers are wicked fast, and their results are strictly reliable (only as good as the Human that runs it), and they can load and store information from memory as many times as we want.

Quantum computers are still too young to have any immediate big applications beyond proof-of-concept ‘computational pilot studies’. (This is assuming government entities have not already started using quantum compute to crack the secret encryption keys of malicious agents or nation states, a very real possibility.) As alluded before however, the primary benefit of a quantum computer is that it will be able to compute many many things at the same time. This will be necessary for any complex simulation or optimization problem. With classical computers, as the number of things we need to keep track of increases constantly, the size of a computer we need to track those things increases fast. Again the beauty of quantum compute is that its particular approach to representing variable quantities makes it possible to perform many calculations at once, whereas a classical computer must perform one calculation at a time.

Another simulation example that quantum computers might be able to help with in the future are physical simulations (at least replacing them with quantum simulations). Sometimes computers just suck so much that we build a tiny thing of the thing we are trying to simulate, and we put that thing in a chamber that is similar to how it will be in real life, then we subject the tiny thing to the stuff it will see in real life. We record the results and boom, another valuable simulation complete. The amount of computer resource to perform such a simulation alone in these cases is so large or costly that we are better off with this analog simulation. Examples of this are, a wind tunnel (cameras watch smoke blow around a wing being simulated in reduced scale, and Humans watch that video to draw their conclusions). Another example is the northern lights simulator. Plasma physicists recognized the cost of simulation (Usim and Vsim are very expensive), so they created a vacuum chamber with a mock planet and sun electrode to generate plasma that would fall into the planet similar to the northern lights. Scientists at NASA used this device to predict that the aurora borealis on Mars is blue and ultraviolet. They did this by filling the simulator with the gas composition of Mars known by spectral analysis from satellites. This blue ultraviolet prediction was verified by satellite, but nobody would have thought to look had not the analog plasma simulator generated the result it did. It may be that digital quantum computers just get good enough to simulate the real thing, or that they get good enough to simulate small toy models.

When it comes down to day-to-day however, we still love our classical computers. I do. In the future, when we want to draft a text document, we will NOT bust out a quantum computer to do so. Likewise, if piece computers take hold, you will NOT use your world piece computer to type stuff and press send or print. This will, alas, still be that obnoxious classical computer that restarts on you randomly in the middle of that ultra important thing you were doing. No, a piece computer rather, will incorporate a classical computer into its construction. Your world piece computer may suggest you need to write a letter to somebody, but it will direct you to your nearest classical computer so that you may do such a thing efficiently. Perhaps your world piece computer will be the thing that ensures you write that letter effectively.

Whatever the case, to get back to our problem (solving global peace), quantum computation should subserve our deepest needs. As modern quantum computers go, their digital approach to optimization, simulation, and brute force mathematical problem solving will go farthest. But it is still digital. Whether you like it or not, besides on/off, happy/sad, white/black, etc, your world is analog and continuous. (My social science brain wonders if the advent of our digital age has contributed to the polarization of our cultures of late.)

~

Okay, so the limiting factor between both classical and quantum computers is that they are digital by design (we don’t yet have analog quantum computers but hopefully this book will help change that). The digital nature means that for most parts, we have to convert our entire world (analog) into digital format. If you ask me to take a system of 1000 equations and optimize for X, I likely won’t be able to do it. The number of mathematical operations this will take will probably take longer than the age of the universe to perform. I need something more efficient. Even a quantum computer though, with 1000 continuous variables, it may be impossible to slam through the computation given the current binary approach we use today.

In short, I am all about keeping things the way they are, and using them in place.

General stuff

So let’s be clear about terminology, because in this book, stuff is an extremely technical term. I do stuff; true. Stuff exists; true. I like stuff; very true. Stuff is everywhere; indubitably true.

Here’s where we might get hung up, so I preempt it. In this book, stuff means anything. For example, when we say, ‘I think about stuff’, it does not mean, ‘I only think about physical objects.’ The way most people usually mean stuff (according to the language they use) is that stuff means both physical and non-physical things. Billiard balls and people and chairs and planets are stuff. So are colors and ideas and concepts and emotions (I feel stuff).

Stuff is so wildly important that I am perpetually amazed by how few physicists preoccupy their time studying generalized stuff. This is, in huge part, what this entire thesis and program is about. If we can somehow formulate a physical theory of reality that accurately describes and predicts the behavior of stuff, then we will be well on our way to solving our hard-hard problems.

We’ll skip the theory stuff for now (we will spend nearly a hundred pages on it later, not including the companion textbook). For now we just care about stuff in the context of computers. Classical computers compute stuff but stuff that is represented in the form of bits and bytes (a byte is an 8 bit word). We want to compute stuff. Ultimately we don’t care about bits; we just care that the stuff is being computed. The moment it turns out that bits are too costly for this, we are done until we invent a new kind of computer. As it turns out, we are pretty much done (unless all you care about in this world is keeping your Outlook up to date, making out Excel spreadsheets board-room ready, and getting those Word documents so nicely WSIWYG that academics go belly up nuts).

To reiterate. The reality is that representing and manipulating stuff in binary is NOT possible when it comes to truly big data and large sets of complex objects (not big data by big compute wonks, talking big data on the cosmic order). If you ask me to compute the final location of the 8-ball after first strike on a triangle of billiard balls, I could probably do that for you if I had a powerful enough computer. But if you asked me to compute the final location of a big bouncy-ball in place of the 8-ball, with jacks and a rowdy littler Terrier that nudges things around as they move, forget the computation, it will  not work.

I’m saying a classical or quantum computer won’t help with the Terrier bouncy-ball jacks problem. This is mainly because we can’t properly model a Terrier. We can probably model the bouncy-ball, jacks, and billiard balls well enough, but not the conscious agent. In any case, an adequate model will be computationally intensive to the extent that is will not be possible to run a simulation with a classical or quantum computer.

Stuff is anything/everything conceivable. This is the definition of stuff that we will adhere to in this book. 
So reiterating the motivation: computers manipulate stuff. In particular, computers take stuff, create a representation of that stuff using bits of some sort, then they use those representations to calculate results from the input of those two stuffs, creating an output.

Let’s go back to piece computer now. The world or universal piece computers involve taking a multitude of things – stuff – within a single person or community’s world, and building a computer which is capable of computing that stuff. Because the stuff that means the most is so incredibly hard to model with a computer – even quantum computers once they have matured – we will need to devise a new way to compute that stuff. We will need to take the stuff we know now, then try to convert it into a standardized form that experiments in the future can replicate and probe.

Why piece computers?

The reason behind fixating on pieces and stuff should begin to click in the context of the above. The conclusion of section one of this chapter should have made it clear: to solve problems with truly big data, modern computers are inadequate, thus if we are to have any hope gaining traction with those problems we must invent a special purpose computer. (This is the general piece computer.)

First though, let us remind ourselves why, specifically, we need to invent a new computer that’s all about peace as a process an a bunch of pieces.

Humans have a lot of massive problems. Solving these problems first demands unity and solidarity, which some argue is the biggest hard problem of them all. This is why we invoke the need for global peace. Now all problems involve a whole lot of stuff. In general our big problems revolve around Humans and their multitude of worlds. We have a lot of stuff, and most of it has a direct impact on our well being and our ability to gain traction on our hard problems. So whatever computer we invent will have to be able to compute all that stuff, including the worlds themselves and the people within them.

If stuff is a general term that means anything/everything (a singular concept), we should recognize that a thing is one unit of stuff. When I say our worlds are full of stuff, I can easily rephrase this to say that our worlds have a lot of things in them. Again, thing in this case means one thing out of anything/everything, be it a tangible object, or an intangible thought or idea.

At this point lets steal a trick from digital computers: lets treat every singular thing as a bit. Now, there are so many things that is would not make sense to consider them all. Instead, lets only consider things that are significant to the computational task of computing stuff to solve our hardest problems. And this is what that confusing choice of words is for: a piece is any significant thing in a world, including the world itself. A world as a whole is what we call world piece, and this includes the Human at the center of said world.

Doubling back to the need for solving global peace, as alluded to it is quite obvious that the challenge of global peace will be in finding the optimal arrangement for all the world pieces and all the pieces.

Thus the special computer we are inventing to solve that massive problem of global peace is aptly called a piece computer. The piece computer discretizes stuff into things and pieces, and runs an optimization algorithm to computer the best arrangement of the pieces at the individual, local, or global scope. Again, the whole reason for inventing the general piece computer is because there are too many pieces, variables, degrees of freedom for a modern digital computer to convert everything to bits, process them Von Neumann style, then convert those bits back into pieces and action on those pieces. Likewise, digital quantum computers are inadequate for this task, too (though they will certainly be a piece within a world/the universal piece computer.

The physical cost of computation

Back to bashing on modern digital computers: not only are massive problems too hard for the Von Neumann processor, but the cost of hardware is prohibitive. For a massive computational problem in a digital computer, every input of pieces that get converted into bits for processing demands the computer have enough memory for all the bits. If we are attempting to compute the dynamics of pieces embedded in our surrounding reality, we will find that there is so much data involved that we won’t be able to afford the memory, nor the physical space to store it. Likewise our processor. We may try to optimize our bit processing by stringing a bunch of graphics processing units to make our computation massively parallel. Even this however, is limited by the space those GPUs occupy, plus the immense amount of energy required to power and cool the digital system. Especially from the perspective of global warming and emissions, modern digital computers are simply unsuited for massive problems because hardware is too expensive—hardware being the physical stuff that actually makes a computer and enables it to do what it does.

So as it stands, our piece computer has a memory and processor problem. How do we avoid the pitfalls of the modern digital computer? Let’s first talk about something called pointers or references from the world of computer science and engineering.

Any novice programmer taking a course in C (a software language) will face something called a pointer, and these so called pointers will cause them a lot of grief. But it need not be so painful, so I will teach you about pointers real quick so you have a leg up on the novice programmer. Lesson one: pointers / references are arguably on of the most important concepts surrounding digital computers today.

Lesson two: pointers are important because they make it so that inside a digital computer we do not have to copy the entire memory of file or chunk of data (big chunk of bits) every time we want to do something with that file or data. Pointers allow us to move bits around, without actually moving them. This nature of the pointer achieves two things. First, the processor is freed up to do more important bit processing than moving bits all over the place like it would need to do in a world without pointers. Second, precious memory is freed up because we can refer to data instead of copying it, or having to move it to faster memory like RAM or cache.

If it isn’t clear already, a pointer or a reference is just that—it is basically like a street sign, or a house address. ‘Downtown’ is downtown, but a few miles away, instead of having to copy downtown at say, the intersection, we use a much more compact sign instead, with a word that uniquely identifies the actual location. Likewise, if I sell my house to somebody, it would be absurd to try moving it to them. Instead, we have a special type of pointer called a title that points to the house via an address. When I make the sale, I pass the title pointer to the next owner, and this is much more efficient (and cost effective) than moving the thing. In computers then, when writing code that instructs the processor what to do with all its bits, we continuously use pointers. I may declare one pointer that points to a large file. Now, every time I want to access the file, instead of copying the file to a variable on my computer’s ‘workbench’, I use the pointer to tell my program where the file is, and from there I can access one line at a time if I wish, not the whole thing.

Thus the overarching lesson of pointers? Whenever possible, leave things in place, and refer or point instead. Whenever possible, don’t copy a thing.

As an interesting aside, in the 70s or 80s [?] Xerox played a role funding and steering the development of the internet we know today. Computer scientists and engineers developing the protocols of the world wide web were faced with the question of ‘do we allow copying files on the internet?’ Obviously, it would be absurd to copy files every time you wanted to access one. After all, this was a computer network, with an address space, and it is0 completely possible to access documents without needing to copy them (you just have to know the address—its pointer. As it turned out, this ideal course fell as direct conflicting interest with their large funder—Xerox. Recall, Xerox is kind of big on the copy machine scene. Surely those computer scientists and engineers didn’t build copy/paste into the early internet just because they didn’t want to alienate their funder…

Now veering away from digital computers and back to pieces, me must recognize that many pieces—significant things—will live in the past, the future, or out of sight. The past piecers are what we call memories, the future pieces are what we call dreams or visions, and pieces out of sight are what we call away. For these pieces, we have myriad different pointers to refer to them. Memories have have pictures that point back to them, or it may be an old song, or a memento. Dreams and vision may be pointed to via some sort of token that serves as a reminder, or art, or a mind-map. Pieces away may be pointed to by something like a wedding ring, or a set of keys, or a phone number, etc.

Pointers permeate our reality.

Human brain

All the preceding leaves us in a position to answer the question of how do we invent our piece computer such that we avoid the pitfalls digital and quantum computers  have when it comes to approaching massive computational problems. How do we solve the hardware problem—memory, processor, and power?

If it isn’t already obvious, it will be now. We need to build the Human brain into the piece computer architecture.

Stay with me! Don’t shut the book now! Ok quick brain lesson. Our brains are wildly efficient. Moreover, the amount of information we process in any given moment is staggering. (One figure I bumped into back studying neuroscience was that the data rate due to neuronal activity across the corpus callosum is something like zetabytes per second. Further, the brain achieves data rates on these orders by consuming tens of milliwatts. Compare this to the zetawatts [?] our internet network consumes. Big difference.)

Even more interesting is the mind. All someone’s pieces (known to them, as some pieces may be unknown) have a pointer representation in the brain. When I remember a memory, my experience of the memory serves as a pointer back to my experience of the original event. When I dream of the future, or think about something I am about to do, my brain’s inner experience serves as a pointer to that future moment. Every piece I know about in my world has a reference or pointers—a representation—in my headspace. Lets call these internal pointers. What happens when I forget about a piece in my world? In this case, I need a reminder. This may be the trivial reminder, where encountering the actual piece is enough to remind me of the piece. This may also be a pointer reminder, where an external pointer (like a memento) triggers the internal pointer of a memory that points to the past.

Our challenge generally is to keep track of all the pieces, past, present, future, imaginary, etc. By building the Human brain into the piece computer, we incorporate an object capable of managing countless pointers, memory of staggering complexity, in the form of external pointers to trigger memories, and internal pointers that capture just the essence of some past, present, future, or imaginary experience. The object is highly efficient, and massively parallel.

The Human brain by definition is the center of a given Human’s world. The remaining big question is, ‘how does the brain actually do the computing?’ Yes, in order to solve the piece optimization problem (to accomplish individual peace, in the case of a single Human) we need the computer—and the brain—to actually do something. Whatever it does, to keep the architecture simple, we define only a single process (called the universal piece). This process is a way for approaching the optimization problem, and acting on results.

Ok we have a brain to manage process, pointers and memory. Interestingly, this process manipulates a complex kind of  bit that we are calling  a piece. (In  terms that a computer engineer or scientist will understand, we have overloaded the bit symbol, but the actual algebra defining the overloaded bits’ behavior  will be covered later.) 

Even more interestingly, and related to bits and pieces, is the quantum nature of the Human brain.  This is not to suggest that the brain is an actual quantum mechanical system (well, it probably is, but nobody has definitively determined [?] just how quantum the brain actually is. The brain is quantum in that is is capable of superimposing states, and in that it continuously quantizes that  surrounding environment.

At the root of things, a piece is only a piece in the context of a conscious being. Before a brain picks through the surrounding landscape and picks out objects (quantizes), the surroundings—all the matter and energy—are really most like a fuzzy blob of stuff.  Discriminating the blob, all the surrounding stuff self-interacts, quantizing itself into things. The things are still amorphous blog, but when a conscious observer observes this thing-blob, it immediately manifests significant pieces out of nothing. We will talk in depth on this later.

On the thing-blob, from a universal perspective every thing is significant (this is a stipulation). The reason the thing-blob is a blob (and the stuff blob prior to differentiation) is that physical boundaries are only really apparent. The reason we ‘see’ objects is that the visible wavelength of light is just the right length that light interacts with things that surround us. The  reason we ‘feel’ objects is that the electrostatic force of the atoms in our skin repels the object. The reality is that our skin and that object never actually touch, and there is actually a ton of open deadspace between the atoms that make up that solid thing you’re looking at. If we try to use a visible light microscope to  view a cell, we can, but if we try to zoom in too much further, the image stops resolving and boundaries look fuzzy. However, if I make the wavelength of the ‘light’ in my microscope very-very small (an electron beam in an electron microscope for example) then I can actually see atoms! Even this though, is apparent. Again, the reality is that the electrons that give the atom its size have no size, and they are only defining the atom’s size in terms of quantum mechanical probabilities, a fuzzy and boundary-less  shape. An exception to all this may be Pauli's exclusion principle.

Tying everything together, a piece computer is built out of a Human brain, plus all the pieces within that world. Some of the pieces are just data, or a pointer. Many pieces however directly assist in the world piece optimization problem.</Text>

            <Title>qualitative difference physics</Title>
            <Text>5786 GPE

Qualitative difference physics has always been present throughout the Global Peace Era. In fact, it's origins are dated to around 14 BGPE, or 2016 in the Judeo-Christian timeline. It took some time to really catch on, but in absolute time Humanity has invested something like 4.7 trillion Human-Years in the effort to create such a physics. (Since the Great Tent Revolution in 1378 GPE, millions of physicists of all levels have timestayed--some for as long as a millenia--extending their lives to contribute deeper and deeper pieces to this particular edifice of Human knowledge.

Nobody really questions the need for qualitative difference physics (QDP) anymore. Its purpose is clear: this physics allows us to explain and predict the interaction of general stuff, according to objective and subjective (qualitative) difference.

(To put this in perspective, a classical example taught to children is of two identical spheres. The only qualitative difference between these two spheres is that there are two of them, their number. This difference may be harnessed to do something useful. In this case, it may be leapfrogging the spheres to act as a ruler of length 2R, or it may be as simple as designating two points of space as 'the same type', etc. Modern QDP is advanced enough to calculate the difference potential between two Human beings, and predict their behavior according to known mechanisms that release energy stored in difference potential. Current work in QDP--the past 314 years--has been to explain the Hard Problem of Consciousness. The motivation here is of course to understand why people choose to do what they choose according to their subjective experience of surrounding qualitative reality.)

Explaining and predicting the behavior of general stuff--it's pretty epic. At this point QDP has been successfully integrated into safety technology, engineering design, policy making, etc, for a very long time. Countless lives have been saved by the simple ability to predict whether two objects or concepts will cause either destruction or creation. Countless tragedies averted, uncountable singular suffering and anguish prevented.

The goal has always been to reliably predict Human behavior without disturbing Human behavior. For a long time people saw the value in explaining interaction between objects and concepts, but most people believed it would be impossible to accomplish the same for Humans due to the fact that Humans would have the knowledge that such a physics exists in the first place. It wasn't until 1580 GPE when the first mathematical proof was published to demonstrate the fact that an observer-object relationship is subject to causal unidirectionality. That is, it is indeed possible to influence a macroscopic intelligent object in a one-way causal manner, even if the intelligent object is aware it is being observed. (The key to this discovery was the proof two years earlier in 1578 GPE which demonstrated the fact that the way an observer defines their scope of time delineates the difference between determinism and free won't.)

Naturally--as there has for millennia--there exists a camp of people who see QDP as yet another object of Human creation that may be used to exploit and do worser harm to others. As it happens though, this camp has become quite small, consisting mainly of conspiratorial skeptics of the global peace system, most of them living in the dark zones of the universal piece computeraz. The reality is that the universal piece computer has become sophisticated enough that constants in Human Nature like greed, manipulation, mal-intent--have all been harnessed by the universal piece to minimize Human suffering and maximize well-being. Though QDP still cannot reliably predict individual Human behavior, Humanity feels a collective sense of peace knowing it is doing everything it can to satisfy The Human Imperative.</Text>

            <Text>1-5 Consilience

This chapter, like the rest in this section, is a prelude for the next section where we get into describing the central invention project in the Time Machine For Peace program. Here we discuss one of the primary functions of the world piece computer: knowledge unification.

Consilience was first popularized by the biologist Edward O Wilson. The idea is that instead of disciplines becoming more and more specialized, siloed and out of touch with each other, we should instead endeavor to bring knowledge together into a whole, unified via a common language (a universal 'knowledge language' so to speak. More technically, this is to create an _ontology_ from all the discrete bodies of knowledge, all the various disciplines.

Unifying knowledge is important in two main regards:

The first is that in terms of solving the global peace problem, we need all the tools we can get. If knowledge is unified, for example to unify art and science, we are more able to traverse to and fro between pure art and pure science at will. The value in this comes from the fact that merging disciplines introduces new language. Art language may be applied to science, and science language may be applied to art. This is powerful because this allows us to make novel -- and more -- associations. If I am a scientist, I can think of my experiment design as an art. The experiment has a gestalt, it has different tone and texture that must be managed. It has instruments in the same way a studio has supplies. The creative process cannot be neglected. On the flipside, if I am an artist, I can think of my current piece as an experiment. There is discovery involved, there is precision control of variables such as stroke weight, length, etc. I can take an unsatisfactory work and turn it into an experiment where I vary parameters, creating hypotheses along the way, to achieve better technique and results. The scientific method cannot be neglected. Cross pollination between peace-based disciplines will provide us with more insight we need to tackle the global peace problem.

The second regard has to do with individual knowledge (and experience). We all have different knowledge we have accumulated over time, and it serves us in many beneficial ways. My knowledge contains insights, knowhow, and tricks (among other things) that serve me very well in my day-to-day. However, you probably don't know all my tricks and insights and knowhow. Likewise me to you, I cannot know all the value you store in your knowledge bank. So, say you and I share similar problems or difficulties. We are both on the hunt for new ways of approaching the same old problems, and the quickest way to do so is to access the person aspect of the Trifecta (doing so however, is at the expense of time and energy). You and I stand to profit by making peace (if not so), and working together to exchange our respective language. We both learn new things and we both walk away from the exchange better equipped to face reality. (Unifying individual knowledge always reminds me of the Vulcan mind meld, but unfortunately we don't have it so easy as telepathy.) The more people unify knowledge with one another, the more equipped we are to solve our hardest problems. The more unification, the more mutual understanding, thus the less likely we are to fall victim to accidental conflict.

So what is the glue here? Be it individuals or disciplines, unifying knowledge has the common element of _language_. In order to unify two bodies of knowledge, there must be a higher degree of _understanding_ between them. If I try to understand your knowledge without knowing how to speak your language, I will fail. Likewise, the people tasked with unifying two disciplines must have the ability to understand the language of both. Language is the glue.

Sometimes understanding language is difficult and nuanced. For example, you and I may both use the word 'dangerous' at times. You may by default say 'dangerous' and mean 'unsafe', whereas I may by default mean 'extremely competent'. If you and I were unifying our knowledge, we may actually need to invent our own shared language between us. The shared language is only ever supplemental (or not, as in the case of invented languages like Esperanto), so we won't need much and in many cases we can invent it as we go.

Things of course get more complicated the more disciplines' and individuals' knowledge we attempt to unify at once. Here we are forced to find something common, but the problem with concepts that span many realms of discourse is that said concepts are often extremely vague and loose, with a myriad meanings between contexts and people. Shared language in this case must be more deliberately crafted.

Thankfully, if we are speaking in terms of unifying peace-based versions of disciplines, this makes the choice of language glue very easy. Such a shared language will revolve about the concept of _peace_ (and as my effort is concerned, the concept of peace as drawn out in this book). Likewise, peace-minded individuals will have an easy time adopting a peace-based shared language because the Time Machine For Peace program is so large it will be infeasible without.

It is tempting to draw back and exclaim, "you’re talking about inventing a universal language!" Not so fast, well, not yet at least. Language in general is 'living' they say. This means it is constantly changing, each news cycle, each inside joke, each movie and new piece of slang. Inventing a shared language cannot constitute a universal language because there is no machinery to facilitate the process of language exchange and evolution. When I say 'universal' I mean so in the sense that I use the word in this book. We'll get to that later or you can check the glossary but suffice to say, 'universal' in this context means between and among worlds. Universal language will not just include a standard language (grammar, lexicon, etc) but it will also include a process -- protocols even -- for connecting worlds of individuals and disciplines. Said process will include procedures (or agreements) to exchange, verify, correct, adjust, etc, the peace-based shared language. These procedures in general will focus on knowledge unification and learning, an educational process.

This is what we will address in section two. We will explore how the concepts of a _world piece computer_ and _the universal piece computer_ will serve as this machinery of language exchange and evolution. World piece computers networked into the universal piece computer, coupled with the shared peace-based language, will be the proper universal language.

Knowledge should live on one tree. The knowledge tree should have only one trunk. By creating peace-based versions of institutions, entities, ourselves, we stand to achieve a meaningful and purpose-driven form of consilience where the trunk is a universal concept of peace. Before we can unify as a people, we will need to begin tackling the unification of knowledge. Before we can do that, we need to disambiguate between the different types of peace that I will use throughout .

This first part sets the stage and is a prerequisite for the main course. My job is to teach you the concepts you will need to participate in, or think critically about this program.

Through my travels speaking with people, a resounding theme is that education will be one of the critical aspects underpinning effective global peace. This book shares qualities of a text book, and me being the author, am here to teach you all about this massive vision that's been stewing in my head for well over a decade. The reason this is educational and not just the quirky entertainment of a futurist, is that I genuinely believe that the contents of this text are invaluable, that they have the ability to help and enhance your world, and to do so now.

Thus, drawing from Verbal Judo's model for education, the educational objective is to motivate you enough to learn a novel way of thinking about peace and computers. The educational goal is use these learnings to expand your mind about what our options are when it comes to the hard question of how to go about solving the war and peace problem. With these learnings and an expanded mind, the hope is that you will have the resources you need to bring peace to your world, and if you already have peace, to enhance it.

            <Title>blocktree, more money, artificial intelligence</Title>
            <Text>At this point, the universal piece computer is close to fully connected. Explosive percolation had begun a few decades ago, and there are only a few disconnected regional world piece computer networks left. Diplomatic work is underway to unite these regional aspects of the universal piece computer with the universal piece computer mainnet. (This of course is disregarding future adopters who may insist on being disconnected.)

People are beginning to talk less about the artificial intelligence (AI) singularity. The realization has been that until we find a way to join consciousness between Humans, then we will not have a way to verify whether or not an artificial intelligence neural network is indeed cognizant. There really is no point is fretting about whether or not an AI is self aware. The best we can do is make sure that if it does happen, then they are treated in a Human manner as part of our species and given the access to Humanity's information that is biased to emphasize our good side. This is in a global sense, as in the case where somebody happens to solve the Artificial General Intelligence problem. One of the current technological pursuits of piece computer scientists and engineers at the moment is to sculpt the universal piece computer into the kind of network that could be used to train such an artificial general intelligence. We already make extensive use of AI for local and global pattern recognition, so this is the natural extension.

Although the siren servers (supermassive centralized servers devoted to collecting data about users then selling it and exploiting it without paying due compensation) of the early 21st century corporations still exist, their influence over the socioeconomic climate of the day has dwindled. In fact, the masses found ways to harness the AI algorithms and engage in a counterintelligence movement against the 3rd party advertising industry (this done, while at the same time tricking the siren server AI into doing useful things other than suggesting garbage). The future is admittedly much more peaceful without advertisements. Now instead, we have advanced AI catalogues that help us find what we need and want. Life is good.

In the effort to make both provenance and the current state of global peace, and the current working definition of Human values crawlable for a general AI, we have leaned hard into a trend of the early 21st century Judeo-Christian Era, decentralization technology. Decentralization was an exciting time for us all. More and more, our precious information began to spread out, control no longer in the hands of a few wealthy elites. For a long time decentralized schemes such as blockchain technologies were still logically central, as everything on a blockchain network is conceptually a single data storage device, the device just being spread out physically, not the data. Eventually directed acyclic graph (DAG) technology took the blockchain decentralization one step further, with data validation and storage being distributed across the network users, not just privileged validators.

The universal piece computer incorporated the blockchain and DAG technologies early on, being a crucial component of every piece computer's piecespace (or memory storage) and piecebrain (cognition). The resulting structure today is effectively like a tree that consists of many trees woven together, one blockchain per use-type for each trunk/limb/branch/twig, part of a bundle of several chain types at each level. This forms a bundle in the form of a tree, everything glued together with a DAG network. (Imagine, for each branch on the tree, there are several types of blockchain bundled into a single branch, same for the trunk, same for limbs, etc. We call this a blocktree, and overall there is only one tree within the universal piece computer. The blocktree is a self-similar structure however, so for every world with a dedicated world piece computer, a smaller blocktree exists that is a tree within the larger tree, containing information that the world needs in order to manage all its pieces. These blocktrees are best thought of as distributed fractal pieceledgers.

At the global level, there is a super pieceledger blockchain within the blocktree that contains what Humanity believes must be accessible from all worlds: that is, our working version of absolute truth about our state of global peace, its history, and tamper-proof. (The tamper-proof ledger is one of the primary ways blockchain technology adds value to society.) We don't all need information at the world level, so world piece computers (for community units and individuals) contain a blocktree bundle that only carries the version of truth that they need. This is the relative truth. This concept reduces down to the level of individual world piece computers. At the lowest level, a world piece computer has access to information both in their individual chain, information in any larger/different world piece computer chains (communities, or others), and information from the global chain. Individuals and community world piece computers may at any time elect to hide their blockchain bundle or even the whole tree from the worlds they are connected to. In many situations, people elect to share their world piece computer information in exchange for monetary compensation. (Hiding a blocktree does not mean the world piece computer is disconnected, just that the information held on it is private.)

This leads us to talking about the most important blockchain use type: monetary. Blockchain as a concept is just a data-structure that is a list where each entry of the list depends on the contents of the previous entry. This is called a hash-linked list. Before the first blockchain called Bitcoin was created in 2008 Judeo-Christian Era (JCE), similar technologies like git likewise employed hash-linked lists to keep track of all changes made in very large computer software code libraries (git came about in 2005 JCE, product of the Linux kernel creation effort, a type of open source computer operating system). Technology like git is good for keeping track of lots of little changes, but it can be tampered with, so it is not good for managing financial ledgers.

Within each world piece computer blocktree, there happens to be a blockchain dedicated to managing a local non-fungible token, or a piecebit (pbit for short) as we call them in general today. (Non-fungible means that one token can't be broken into lesser denominations or fractions, and token just means 'unit of value'). There is one unique pbit type per world peace computer. If the operator / operators of a world piece computer do not wish to mint any additional piecebits for interworld/intraworld exchange, then the world is registered as having only a single piecebit--itself. The global chain of the universal piece computer maintains a ledger of world piecebits, but only their existence. (Connected world piece computers that wish to remain anonymous are represented as such, and world piece computers that are disconnected and unknown are represented in the universal piece computer by the unknown piecebit.)

Some time ago, the classical currencies as known by the people of the Judeo-Christian Era collapsed, but thankfully very gently. (Some thank the universal piece computer for providing a tested alternative well in advance of the collapse. In reality, we probably just got lucky.) By the time of the collapse the universal piece computer had implemented a global non-fungible piecebit series called the upcbit. Each upcbit has its own mint, and its own value. For each world connected to the universal piece computer, a upcbit is minted, and corresponds with this value. Although the upcbit is indivisible, the corresponding world piece computer may mint as many pbits as they please. Though each pbit minted must be non fungible (or it must be irreducible) the value of a pbit is defined as the irreducibility constant for an individual or community, times the number of individuals in a community (or just one), divided by the number of pbits minted. The irreducibility constant--put roughly--is defined as the total global wealth divided by the population, then multiplied by a factor of ten, though this factor fluctuates.

For a long time, upcbits were minted, then placed in a fund, or a pool. Early on, after long and rocky relationship with the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States of America, the universal piece computer worked out an agreement to tether the upcbit portfolio to a portfolio of global fungible currencies. The two entities devised a scheme for exchanging upcbit assets for regular fungible currency (but those details are too complex to discuss here). The portfolio was then sold to peace-minded investors in what is now known as The Great Exchange, effectively a global public offering of irredeemable assets. As it stands, this was only accepted from a social and legal perspective because as a condition for the exchange, the universal piece computer and all its world piece computers had to legally bind themselves to being all-money-in legal entities. An all-money-in entity is something that generates revenue and profit for the sake of dumping the profits back into local world piece computer development (community and self improvement), and contributing to the universal piece computer global operational costs. The universal piece computer does not accumulate wealth, rather, it uses wealth strictly to fund the time machine for peace social invention program.

The big point is that eventually upcbits (each representing a community) took on monetary value in a global sense. Within the universal piece computer, a plurality of value tokens existed, while outside the universal piece computer, there was just money. When the two realms merged in The Great Exchange, world piece computers found that they could leverage their pbits in the same way that fungible currency banks do. What seemed like overnight, everybody had more money, that money was less liquid, but everybody had a lot more spending power.

Instead of once having only a single currency to make promises with, to exchange goods for, now each individual and each community had a unique currency, and promissory notes took on a higher resolution. When a person could not receive compensation for work or wisdom unless the recipient had traditional-money, now anybody could pay anybody with whatever pbit types in their possession. To act as guidelines for exchange, the global chain provides value suggestions that are generally measured in a practical local units, such as meals, or gallons of water, etc (but that's a different conversation).

One thing this accomplishes is that it defines value in terms of individuals and in terms of the individual networks they form, not in terms of physical resources. Introducing plural media of value exchange that are less liquid works to enforce a core positive peace bias of the universal piece process: that world piece computer connections should favor commitment, and relationship (verses non-commitment and isolation). If a person accepts their community's currency because of some work performed, they have received an I-owe-you, and although that currency may not be accepted in a different community, that person may visit any store within the paying community to buy some groceries. The ultimate value of a pbit is determined by its honorability. This encourages people to stick together, because they share a common economic interest. This encourages people to get to know each other when they otherwise wouldn't, and thus are more likely to discover mutual opportunities to create new value.

Another example might be that a friend helps another friend move, and that friend pays their helper with their personal currency. The paid friend may redeem this currency--this I-owe-you--at any point in the future within reason, by asking them to help with something. At some point, the friend who owes help may wish to cancel that obligation--say, one less thing to worry about--so they buy back their currency in exchange for some agreed on amount of the two friends' local community currency. This applies globally as well, for those people who need mobility between communities at a high level.

Today we believe that value comes from individual relationships, not things, so this approach to value exchange has proven extremely effective. Humans form relationships, so the more ways we have to measure Human relationships, then the more value we can extract in countable form. That's where the monetary blocktree system comes in: balances and flows are tracked in a tamper-proof manner across all scopes, individual, local, and global. These days the pbit blockchains keep record of all these additional pbit transactions, and the result is a collection of information about value preference that individual and local world piece computers may elect to share or sell to larger entities and piece computers. Likewise, the universal piece computer blocktree keeps track of provenance, or the history of creative work. Individuals and communities are constantly adding and removing smart contract agreements that define propagating payment schemes and general royalties. It is not uncommon for people to simply cite their friends and family for wisdom and knowledge transfer, or even epiphanies, instigating automatic 'royalty' payments in their local or individual currency.

The monetary blocktree is just one in the blocktree bundle. Another blocktree which all world piece computers share (again with almost no exception) is the general piece ledger. The piece ledger is a tamper-proof record of pieces in a world. World pieces take all forms, and some pieces are impossible to store in today's blocktrees (a memory, for example) though we may always store a pointer to such a piece in the blocktree (say, a note describing the memory). For some things, the blocktree stores information like official documents, deeds, wills, etc. When a world piece computer is properly set up, the collection of recorded pieces in the world acts like a set of datastreams, one per piece. All these datastreams evolve over time, and the blocktree captures their change.

There are several other applications that world piece computers use the blocktree for. These other blockchain types aren't really important for this conversation though. The point is that these days, we track all the important stuff, and the information is ours. The world piece computer is personal, unique to the individuals and communities that operate them. In general, the default permissions of a world piece computer reflect the operator's value set.

At the moment we are safely in what we call a Humanistic Digital Information Society. Information about everything we do is accessible, protected, and people get paid for what they share and contribute on a continuous basis (and not just pocket change).

People back at the advent of blockchain technology we often quick to limit their way of thinking about distributed ledger technology to the realm of electronic computers. Relatively quickly though, it was shown that this technology could be implemented with virtually any medium, and sometimes, with no medium at all. The reality is that the ordered collection of pieces within connected world piece computers--ultimately forming the universal piece computer--form the distributed piece ledger itself. The ledger is simply our minds and the spacetime that surrounds us. This is the memory of the universal piece computer, a general component called the piecespace. The collection of all piecespaces in the universal piece computer is what we call today, the universal piecetree.</Text>

            <Text>NGPE - 3030

It has only been three thousand and thirty years since the resolution of Humanity's first interstellar war with another cellular life form. The outcome was horrific--around 1.2 trillion Humans perished--but we prevailed as usual, even found a partner. By this point the universal piece computer spans tens of solar systems, plus numerous gargantuan mining, research, and transport outposts.

At first attack, we immediately put our universal piece to work to compute a solution. Unfortunately, even with timestay tents, we were pressed on time: the enemy possessed technology that could create a trajectory through timespace capable of velocities on order of time compression within tents. (They developed this weapon in tandem with developing their first faster-than-light technology.) Extinction was clearly imminent, so in one last desperate effort we resorted to lethal force. The catch this time was that we didn't pull the trigger of total annihilation.

Outgunned but not outnumbered, we leveraged the savagery of Human Nature, the technology of our allies, and managed to swarm the attacking force and homeworld, injecting an insidious hybrid nanotech bioweapon into their species' biomass, a first step toward peace, compelling a ceasefire by resorting to the best brute force tactic we know to date--mutual assured destruction. After a few demonstrations of force, the enemy species laid down its arms, agreeing to engage in diplomacy to dismantle the mutual assured destruction mechanism.

This was a dark moment for Humanity, for we are no longer killers by choice. War always carries with it collateral damage, so avoiding it was a central part of The Human Imperative from the beginning of the PCE. We mourned the loss of our own, and we mourned the loss of our enemy's noncombatants. And the terror of mutually assured destruction, although we knew it could be reversed, instilled for the first time a collective species-wide feeling of guilt. Of course there are still war mongers among Humans, but they have a tiny and insignificant voice these days. We still feel guilty, and rightly so.

The resulting diplomatic relations, motivated by peace and reconciliation, revealed some surprising epiphanies:

First, our assailants came from a three-body system of planets orbiting one another, revolving around a single star. We came to call them the Triplanetarians, the literal translation of their stated name in native tongue. The Triplanetarian system is a chaotic system meaning that is it impossible to calculate the trajectory of any one planet for too far into the future. (This is due to something called sensitivity to initial conditions, one of the outstanding ancient problems that still baffles mathematicians to date.) We learned that Triplanetarians only recently discovered faster than light travel, which was surprising given how advanced their weaponry was. We learned how long they have flourished on three planets in such a chaotic environment and calculated the odds of their three home worlds surviving, turning out to be an infinitesimally small number. (The alien species is literally the luckiest life form know to Humanity.) The majority of the Triplanetarian species however (several trillion), lives on this three-planet system due to their relatively primitive space travel abilities. The moment they developed faster than light travel, they set out to find new worlds to inhabit. The important part here however, is that Triplanetarian society evolved in a strict climate of fear, a species constantly afraid that the next ten solar cycles might very well be their last. It was an entire intelligent species whose collective psyche was rooted in fear.

Second, as per protocol--in effort to erect a universal language channel between species--we introduced the concept of world piece computer to begin the universal piece language exchange and education process. What we found was that Triplanetarians also had world piece computers (with their own functioning universal piece computer of networked world piece computers). Their computers were likewise devoted to overcoming  time, and they too had a similar great tent revolution several thousand years ago. We discovered a similarity between their piece computers with some piece computers we had seen early within our species way back in the Piece Computer Era--these were particularly pathological cases of piece computer implementations. If the programming of a world piece computer is biased in terms of fear, anger, and hatred, we discovered that that world soon becomes hostile (obviously). The reality for Humans though, was that the overarching universal piece computer was programmed first with love and unity in mind, and because it was programmed this way first, good always seemed two steps away from the little 'evil' confronting the time machine for peace invention program--ie, the little bits of evil that we were incapable of harnessing to do useful work. Some mathematical historians these days believe that because our piece computers were first programmed for good, when our Great Tent Revolution freed up our time, we were able to more quickly develop faster than light technology--suggesting that our positive bias is ultimately what saved us from the Triplanetarians.

Thirdly, the Triplanetarians as it turns out, having programmed their first universal piece process according to fear, the very origin of it all mostly was a reflection of their social fear-based climate at the time, several thousand years ago. We learned that because they came to think in terms of fear, they believe in an ancient idea that we know as the dark forest hypothesis. In fact, the dark forest hypothesis was baked into their universal piece from the beginning. The dark forest hypothesis suggests that the cosmos are filled only with predatory species, and so the only way to ensure one's survival is to annihilate other life forms upon discovery; this is the only safe course of action. So that's what happened (or almost happened, rather). Triplanetarians discovered us and immediately went to war. (We were as prepared as we could be, given our weaponry's technological status, but honestly our greatest weapon was our superior faster than light travel abilities.)

These three epiphanies formed the basis to a diplomatic solution that ultimately led to a close allied friendship with the Triplanetarians.

We communicated this difference between universal piece computers. We also shared our experience with other cellular lifeforms, our allies (of which they had none, as they were living in isolation). We explained that although the dark forest hypothesis may apply to certain pathological scenarios, there is actually a superior hypothesis that better fits the data and is ultimately more productive: this is the light forest hypothesis. The light forest hypothesis so far has been validated numerous times, and the Triplanetarians were the first case of the dark forest hypothesis that Humans have encountered. (Common belief is that there are some galactic regions where the dark forest hypothesis is the prevailing model, but that is not ours.) The Triplanetarians were stunned. In fact, they were elated, because we offered them immediate refuge and safe--war-free--passage to new homes.

We had one condition though: Triplanetarians must reprogram their universal piece and world piece computers to be biased in terms of our universal piece based in love. They had one thousand years to comply. We programmed an automated smart contract system of overwatch nodes to activate the nano bioweapon in the event of an attack. The nano bioweapon contained a mechanically cryptographic element that would only allow external molecular interaction with presentation of the proper molecular cryptographic key. This was absolute terroristic savagery, but then again, we couldn't just trust them, and the Triplanetarians were used to living in fear so they were surprisingly amiable to the arrangement. They were just happy we wanted to help them find a new safe home world and spread roots to new solar systems.

What we noticed however, was that it only took a couple hundred years for the Triplanetarians to reprogram and evolve their social psyche into one with positive bias, basically overnight. We tested this extensively. We quickly began to collaborate on mutual interests, and once our species' effort were intertwined enough that we were clearly interdependent, we agreed to neutralize the nano bioweapon. This was 790 years ago. Since then we have become partners with a common interest: develop the time machine for peace invention program. (In the case of the Triplanetarians, this meant in part to solve the three-body problem, and learn how to manipulate such systems.) Toward this end we have rigorously applied our shared qualitative difference physics to harness the apparent differences between species for the sake of continued scientific discovery. Derivations and following insights has been fruitful.

Like most serendipity, we made a startling mutual discovery just this year, 1000 years after committing to peace with the Triplanetarians: put plainly, we are actually the same. The Triplanetarians provided the final datapoint we needed to draw this conclusion.

(Up to this point, our allies preferred to maintain strict personal boundaries, as they had since the pre-Judeo-Christian era of Humanity. We were not to study each others' bodies nor ecosystems. We did not have access to the bodies of an alien life form, but we communicated, exchanged technology, ideas, and shared spacetime as friendlies.)

By uniting with the Triplanetarians, we finally had the opportunity to compare two evolutionary biomes and their inhabitants one-to-one. Analyzing the difference relationships between countless life forms compared to their evolutionary environmental context, a pattern emerged. As we know now, Human Nature is general, it permeates all living organisms, and only varies by matter of degree. At the lowest level of life, Human Nature reduces to the dimension of taxis. Life attracts to stimuli that help it grow, and is repulsed by stimuli that destroy it. Higher up, once brains start to develop, Human Nature takes on higher complexity, introducing phenomena such as fear and desire, further driving the primal dimension of taxis. Eventually we reach the known pinnacles of Human Nature, highly intelligent life. This space of Human Nature is often referred to as universal instinctual tendency. Universal Instinctual tendency has a common will: procreate and complexify.

In all cases of instinctual tendency, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the body that experiences taxis, and an inner subjective feeling. In the highest lifeforms with highest complexity, the body additionally takes on the form of imagination or self, which likewise has a one-to one correspondence with subjective feeling. In organisms with imagination, the imagination itself takes on the will to procreate just like the physical body, but instead of crawling a generalized genetic landscape, is crawls a generalized memetic landscape. This is what we have referred to as identity, each individual being like a species in-and-of itself.

At first glance this really isn't so profound. What is profound is how QDP demonstrates in a testable, predictive way that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between biological form, and subjective experience (after adjusting for difference in language of course). The resulting principle is what is remarkable about this discovery. That is, the principle of qualitative equivalence.

Qualitative equivalence means that if two if two organisms share the same physical or imaginary structure, then those two organisms have the same raw subjective experience that correlates with said structure. If we both have cones in our eyes that interact with visible light at around 700 nanometers, then we will both experience the same essence of redness. (However, the words we use to describe the color red my differ, but this is a different conversation.) The differences in experience are generally apparent only, stemming from variation and meaning derived from the context of other, surrounding subjective qualities in an organism's experience space.

There will certainly be skeptics for many years to come, and rightly so. The point is that the mathematics of QDP demonstrate that this equivalence principle is the most rigorous and consistent relation between the objective and the subjective components of an organism. Currently, there is a race to verify the principle via as many different physical experiments as possible. The scientific and mathematical climate is charged.

The implications of qualitative equivalence are vast. Stated without proof, by our current understanding the universe may be expressed as three unified parts: object, image, and mindmachine. There exists a one-to-one correspondence between object and image, linked at points by conscious entities called mindmachines, consciousness being the expression of universal instinctual tendency (Human Nature), and varying by degree.

A mindmachine is what we think of when we think 'life form', and each is driven by Human Nature (ie the universal instinctual tendency). We cannot prove that our form of mindmachine is unique, so for now Humanity specifies that life as we know it is a mindmachine rooted in timespace, and comprised of matter. We are timespace matter mindmachines.

Timespace derived from the obvious fact that qualities and cycles prevails over spacetime (spacetime being just one qualitative dimension of timespace). Matter in this case means the combination of fermionic and bosonic matter, or the material composition of an organism and its self-interaction. Mindmachine is the unique bit, being the literal bridging point between the object of an organism and the inner subjective image. This bridge is what we think of when we think my sense of self. (We must specify that a mechanical object comprised of matter is responsible for the mind, because it may be possible that conscious life forms emerge from a different sort of mechanism, such as in purely within the timespace ideaspace itself, as one hypothesized example.)

All this is significant for a few reasons.

For one, it lends to a possible mechanism that bridges the elusive and enigmatic gap between objective and subjective reality--or that singular entity we know as self. Advanced physicists long ago proposes that the conscious experience is literally the shape that motion of matter makes as it flows throughout the brain, or, our brain's smear through timespace. This is both the photons of a neuronal impulse, and the molecules of a synaptic release. This is our mindmachine in the simplest expression.

Further, the motion of matter changes rate and direction. Physicists believe that the change of rate in matter flow--the acceleration--is ultimately the seat of our self.

The tantalizing suggestion is that actual intelligence is the change in acceleration of this flowing matter within our brains, which may be the change in our sense of self. The hope is that we can identify the seat of consciousness--the free agent--by identifying the source of such changes in acceleration.

Above all the discovery of qualitative equivalence is important because it provides a general construct for describing consciousness, in terms of a general construct that we call the timespace matter mindmachine. By our individual experience, consciousness is a singular irreducible point or space attaching object space to image space. All matter flow through a brain--even spatial translation--may be expressed as rotation about this conscious point. (Recall, motion in a straight line, if relative to a single point, is a form of rotation.)

Thus we find ourselves faced with the grand hypothesis:

Consciousness is the rotation of stuff.

Many of us are aware of how absurd this sounds, especially in the eyes of the ancients. It doesn't matter, for it is the best we have to go off of. Solving the Hard Problem of Consciousness--the question of why our subjective experience feels the way it does--demands a mechanism, even if we don't understand it fully, or even at all.

Let's take a step back to look at the big picture.

The year is 3030 New Global Peace Era, the advent marked by peace with the Triplanetarians. We are still working faithfully on the time machine for peace invention program. Our primary concern is to solve the multi-body problem (the generalized three-body problem) motivated primarily by the imminent threat to the Triplanetarian home worlds. (As we know now, chaos underpinning the multi-body chaotic system is inextricably linked to the irreversibility of time.) The Triplanetarians are exceedingly lucky, but we cannot count on that luck.

On a deeper concern however, we are focused on death. The second law of thermodynamics as specified by our ancient ancestors in the Judeo-Christian Era is just as elusive on the cosmic scale now as it was back then. (We can violate it systematically on a local level, but then again even our ancients could do this with their refrigeration technology, for example--nothing special.) The problem we face is that as far as the evidence is concerned, our universe is still expanding, and we even know now that the rate of acceleration itself may be accelerating. The evidence still suggests the same thing as it did many millennia ago: the heat death of the universe is inevitable. 

Proving we are all the same--that we are all just timespace matter mindmachines who share the same subjective experience, just different aspects of it--is the crucial piece we needed to start really making sense of consciousness in a scientific sense, not just philosophical. That qualitative equivalence is a fundamental aspect of reality, this is the unifying concept we need to make sense of self.

Besides the quacks, we (via our bispecies-wide polydemocratic universal piece governance process) almost unanimously agree that we now have what we need to move forward and commit to the next era of The Universal Peace Plan, the roadmap for the time machine for peace invention program. The New Global Peace Era was very short compared to the Piece Computer Era and the preceding Global Peace Era.

We have waited a long time, put in a staggering number of Human years worth of research and development, and the time has finally come for us to really focus on inventing a way to survive eternity. The year is 3030, the dawn of a new era, the era of the timespace matter mindmachine.</Text>

My goal in providing you this book is to teach you a new language that literally rewires your brain in terms of peace, which by my belief will change the way you think act for the better.

Compared to your default ways, I think you stand to benefit -- profit even -- from seeing and interacting with the world around you in terms of peace.

As an experiment, I would like to know whether or not people who think in terms of peace do live more profitable lives.

If you read this book and commit to understanding by internalizing its contents (which I highly recommend), you become a member of the experiment's test population. If you read this book and do not internalize the contents, you become a member of the experiment's neutral population. And if you do not read this book, you belong to the control (default) population.

N = 1 studies, surveys, polls will be conducted after some minimum readership has been established, and enough time passed. The results may be published in future editions.

Eventually we will have access to the resources we need (test and control populations, scientific and medical facilities) to perform more sophisticated studies. This will certainly include comparing brain activity between subjects using CT and MRI scans of their brains. Scans will also help us determine correlates between brain structure and peace-based thought patterns.

Ultimately this research will map general peace-related experience to brain function and structure, and this will give us the opportunity to determine a difference map between peaceful thought, neutral thought, and warlike thought. Identifying key differences should lead to insights into how to lessen differences by root cause analysis.</Text>

            <Text>piecebrain
This is one of three components that make up a piece computer. The piecebrain makes decisions about how a piece computer should function (managing inputs, outputs, and inner workings). The default piecebrain is the Human brain, and by definition it is impossible to have a piecebrain without a Human brain. The piecebrain is analogous to the processor in a modern computer, but also includes the computer operator. usage: my piecebrain is bad at thinking about math, so I added Wolfram Alpha to my piecebrain to help me figure out how many different ways I can arrange the pieces in my world.

pieceprocess
This is one of three components that make up a piece computer. The pieceprocess in a piece computer is one aspect or facet of the universal piece, which is the sum of all peace processes running in a given moment. The pieceprocess is analogous to a process in a modern computer, but there is only one. usage: My piece computer runs my personal pieceprocess, which is what helps manage my world's pieces, constantly optimizing their arrangement and presence.

piecespace
This is one of three components that make up a piece computer. The piecespace is where all the pieces are stored, and in general this is the ambient environment that surrounds us. The piecespace is analogous to the memory in a modern computer (all the different types). Because the Human brain is a prerequisite component in any piece computer, part of a computer's piecespace will exist as the Human brain's memory itself. usage: My memory often fails me, so I  leave physical clues--or pointers--in my surrounding piecespace to remind me of important things I need to do.

WE / US
This is the inclusive combination of I, we, Humanity, and any intelligent beings with humane quality. In other words, WE represents the three scopes of interest considered together, individual, local (community), and global. US is the direct object form of WE. usage: WE should do something epic and noble. (This translates to: I, my community, my nation, my people, and Humanity at large should do something epic and noble. usage: Peace should explicitly matter to US. (This translates to: Peace should explicitly matter to me, my community, my nation, my people, and Humanity at large.)

Computer Architecture

This is a big chapter. Here we discuss the overall shape and quality that characterizes the universal piece computer and world piece computers. If the last section helped make you more receptive to the scope and subtleties that surround your preconceptions of 'computer', then you should have an easier time understanding this section. The architecture described here is extremely different, essentially foreign to what you know about computers in a general or technical sense. It's okay if you don't understand at first, it took me a while to get there too.

This computer architecture must be thought of as all the world piece elements forming a whole, being the universal piece computer. The architecture is fractal, and applies equally to both individual elements and the whole at large. In fact, an accurate technical name for the architecture of the universal piece as a whole may very well be a computational piece fractal.

In the first section we'll start the lesson by talking about the generality of stuff in the context of computers. We will then work to understand why this generality is needed, and what it looks like in practice. We will talk about the critical role of the Human brain. This will involve reflecting on quantum computation, Von Neumann computation, resolving with discussion about memory, pointer variables, and time.

The next section will involve applying the above toward describing the structured relationship between the universal piece computer, world piece computers, and world pieces. This will involve defining the sole hierarchy between components, and describing how world piece computers nest and connect laterally. We will 

discover how the universal piece can be singular but in many places at once. We will also discover how a world piece computer connected to a world piece with fewer world pieces looks equivalent to the universal piece computer (is, in fact). We finish this section by addressing the primary difference between the universal piece computer and world piece computers: the Human brain.

Finally we put the pieces of the architecture together. How does the architecture let us meld everything together? How do we generalize this architecture to be agnostic to which computer type we are referring to -- universal or world? We explore a little about the role of different embedded computer architectures present within, and talk about how the peace-based architecture may be seen as a hybrid of the quantum and Von Neumann architectures. We conclude by reviewing three simple yet essential components that define the universal piece computer and world piece computers in general.

From here out, instead of saying 'the universal piece computer and world piece computers' every time, I will refer to the pair simply as 'piece computer'. Piece and peace are disambiguated by context, by articles 'a' (world) piece computer

This section is where things start to get a little wild, so please approach what follows with an open mind.

            <Text>1-3 We Can't Wait!

The inevitability of peace only makes sense by making a little caveat: global peace may be inevitable, but only if we don't go extinct first. This seems like a pretty obvious and trivial statement but it bears inspection. We cannot just sit back and expect global peace to happen.

From one angle, our extinction very well may be imminent, as we grapple with the consequences of global warming and impending peak population among other things. Likewise, as tensions mount in more and different ways on the global stage, the possibility of world nuclear war or a third world war is real. From another angle, without introducing any new knowledge to the equation of how we understand reality, extinction may be physically inevitable.

In any case, for us to be at peace with the looming threat of extinction, we must be able to honestly tell ourselves that we are doing everything we can to ensure our survival. Unfortunately backing up our species on Mars doesn't mean much if we cannot find the will to unify and deliberately situate ourselves to face our existential problems on Earth with solidarity.

Stated without proof or justification, it very well may be that we cannot solve our deepest existential problems as a species if we do not learn how to prioritize peace on a global scale. When the stakes are survival itself, it makes conservative sense to _assume_ we need to put global peace first. If we can create a meaningful form of global peace, we stand to liberate that much more Human time and energy for the purpose of studying and solving our existential problems. If it turns out we do not need to prioritize peace, yet we attain it anyway, then the liberated time and energy will make it that much sooner that we solve problems like global warming and peak population.

Assuming we _do_ need global peace to overcome our existential problems, given the progression of global warming we will need to attain some semblance of global peace in the next 10-20 years. If we can leverage the powers of exponential growth and explosive percolation within networks (more on that later) this may indeed be possible.

People are constantly talking about what will be the death of us. Many people believe this will be global warming, many others believe this will be the erosion of our traditions, our institutions, our values, etc. In every case the scenario is the same: we have a ton of different people all yelling at once about what they think the most important death-of-us problem is to face. If we are to ever have hope for thinking straight about these issues, we will first need to stop shouting so much. The circular catch is that the only thing that will make the shouting stop is the calmness of peace, but to have peace and calm people need to stop shouting. It seems like most of the shouting is born from fear and anger at injustice or futility.

It seems this type of fear and anger is often a reaction to the feeling that we aren't taking this or that death-of-us problem seriously enough. What we need for us to all stop shouting at once, is the common knowledge that no matter what death-of-us problem you get riled up about, we as Humans have a single global peace system in place that is fostered to ensure we are methodically and deliberately taking all death-to-us problems seriously. Similar to how the presence of a police and fire department make it easy to live homelives carefree of scary stuff, an effective global peace system would likely have a similar calming and soothing effect. Certainly there are people who will never stop shouting, but for those people such a peace system would validate and record the content of the shouting, then build some sort of figurative 'noise box' to contain the din.

A vagabond once suggested that global peace would be more aptly called 'The Great Hush'. We can't work together as a species if we cannot find a way to hear ourselves over the din of Humanity. If one is faced with a crisis or a existential threat, the obvious advice is to remain calm, cool, and collected, think, and avoid hysteric panic at all costs. If we want global peace, we need to learn how to shut up. If we can't shut up, we need to ensure that the people capable of impact have channels in place that facilitates communication between them, despite the noise.

So the prudent course: Healthy pessimism dictates we assume that global peace is a prerequisite to solving our hardest problems. Then, healthy optimism dictates we assume global peace is an inevitability. Finally, healthy realism dictates we assume the worst and design for the best. We cannot sit back and expect global peace to happen, so we must instill some urgency and make it happen. Put plainly, don't wait. Global peace needs to be explicitly prioritized, and now.</Text>

This first part sets the stage and is a prerequisite for the main course. My job is to teach you the concepts you will need to participate in, or think critically about this program.

Through my travels speaking with people, a resounding theme is that education will be one of the critical aspects underpinning effective global peace. This book shares qualities of a text book, and me being the author, am here to teach you all about this massive vision that's been stewing in my head for well over a decade. The reason this is educational and not just the quirky entertainment of a futurist, is that I genuinely believe that the contents of this text are invaluable, that they have the ability to help and enhance your world, and to do so now.

Thus, drawing from Verbal Judo's model for education, the educational objective is to motivate you enough to learn a novel way of thinking about peace, particularly in terms of computers. The educational goal is use these learnings to expand your mind about what our options are when it comes to the hard question of how to go about solving the war and peace problem. With these learnings and an expanded mind, the hope is that you will have the resources you need to bring peace to your world, and if you already have peace, to enhance it.

As it turned out, it is impossible to understand another person's experience--their way of seeing the world--without the context of all that person's accumulated past experience. Qualitative context









The superancients had many thoughts about what it would mean to join consciousness. They were all rather primitive.

Qualitative difference physics now specifies a mechanism for qualitative (subjective) experience. We still don't know why qualities feel the way they do, but we do know that quality only exists because consciousness is a comparative process that meters the passing of linear time

Blah blah blah 

These days, the universal piece computer handles most interpersonal and innerpersonal disagreements automatically. Nonproductive conflict is relatively rare, but when it does happen, the consequences are more intense because the state of global peace is an intricate, delicate, dynamic balance. The computer is constantly correcting and adjusting to account for the evolving sensitivity of initial conditions.

Several years ago the universal piece computer identified two world pieces trapped in a state of fundamental disagreement, but in close confines, two Human individuals sharing a community with mutual loved ones. The typical automatic rhetorical agreement processes failed over and over. Relative peace between these two Human worlds was rather low quality, and consistently caused inner turmoil within these two inhabitants and their community love units. At a particularly low point, negative cycles resonated and the community witnessed a highly energetic hatred flare between the two.

These days, much of the universal piece looks more like a game than any sort of stuffy diplomatic conference room business. These two individuals play the role of guardians in the universal piece process. Guardians are often responsible for the well being of billions of living Human souls at a time, for their job is to maintain and protect the eternity bubbles. Within eternity bubbles, people live out immortal lives without the need for intrusive live support systems, however they choose.

Guardians usually elect to live in communities outside the eternity bubbles because they prefer the thrill of being in direct contact with the Wilder-ness. The Wilder-ness, most guardians find, is just a more interesting experience (albeit often quite uncomfortable). Guardians recognize that compared to life in the Wilder-ness, life in eternity just really isn't that real. They also recognize that the sense of purpose they derive from looking over so many souls--loving families, communities, societies, species--makes life feel more worth living, just more gratifying and enjoyable in general.

There are risks of course. Humanity may have solved mortality, but unwelcome death is still a grave problem. The Wilder-ness is as it always has been, full of diverse dangers and under constant threat from the terror singularity. Guardians are the brave ones, and eternity bubble inhabitants are grateful for their commitment.

So the stakes are high. Being responsible for the unwelcome death of one Human is unthinkable these days, not to mention accidentally bursting an entire eternity bubble. Usually eternity bubbles burst due to some unexpectable lurking danger in the Wilder-ness, but on rare occasion the universal piece computer malfunctions and an accidental bubble burst occurs. This is often considered to be one of the few pure horrors a Human being can experience in current past-times. When a guardian community fails and their eternity bubble bursts, it is not uncommon for the entire community--millions of guardians--to elect mass suicide to make inner peace with the inconceivable communal experience of guilt, shame, and horror.

So focus is of paramount concern for guardians. The universal piece computer is important within eternity bubbles, but in the Wilder-ness the computer sustains safety and life.

The first signs that a peace disturbance was unsettling within this particular guardian community was a momentary lapse in attention during an observation protocol. The lapse was was caused by an intrusive thought within one Human being, an echo of a past, in this case an unresolved negative memory piece relating to another Human being (a coguardian in fact). It was just a blink of an interruption, but had it occurred at the exact wrong timepoint, their eternity bubble could easily have burst. The universal piece process fluctuated momentarily and provoked the being to disconnect from the helm and seek out resolution with the offending coguardian.

The coguardian was welcoming and eager resolve the peace erosion. They fought to resolve the mutual negative memory pieces. Unfortunately the usual protocols broke down, the two at an impasse. In any other case the universal piece computer would prescribe the two worlds self-separate, but in this case the two guardians shared love bonds with mutual community members--family.

The negative memory pieces were generated by a mutual irreconcilable wrongdoing. These pieces are usually suppressed and accepted, but in close quarter, the intrusive thoughts provoke mutual hatred. The hurt caused by the other is inconceivable, the reasons unjustifiable, but each feels the same sense of unforgettability. In fact, mathematically speaking, in their current state of being the two guardians were literally incapable of making peace.

Monitoring the situation, the universal piece computer noticed more intrusive negative memory pieces distract the attentions of these two guardians. Surrounding guardians were deeply concerned, and the two guardians at odds were likewise concerned. This was simply too much internal risk exposure to a bubble burst event. In fact, the entire community was worried. The last thing anybody wanted to do was exile the two guardians, as that would sever the love bonds thus introducing more risk of negative memory piece invasion. The vicious cycle of inner war was imminent.

Everybody is honest about the fact: the state of fundamental disagreement between two Human beings is not possible to overcome, especially when the beings are different. In any sense of time, if love bonds are involved and subject to resulting conflict, then the cycle of war ensues. The only way for a Human being to resolve a fundamental disagreement with another being is to introduce time--the linear spectrum of qualitative experience--and experience how they see things.

The timeancients could not appreciate how difficult this is. A common ancient belief was that 'experiencing what somebody else experiences' would be as simple as just plugging brains together. No. This is a nontrivial task. The guardian community met. This was officially developing into an existential crisis. The universal piece process converged to a point: the two Human guardian beings must use the time machine for peace to perform the existential identimeld procedure.

The two guardians reluctantly agreed. They knew this was best, and they knew that their past grievances were not worth holding on to if it meant an accidental eternity bubble burst--they would be responsible for the guilt and probable mass suicide of their entire love bonded guardian community. They prepared for the procedure. This procedure was never without risk of accidental death. Sometimes a Human being just doesn't have the strength to identimeld. In every case however, the procedure is fatal.

It helps to take a step back and consider the following: living in the Wilder-ness is overwhelming. There is just so much, everything. Conscious singular organisms (timespace matter mindmachines) bound by linear time emerged because this the only way that the concept of sense can exist. Otherwise, nothing makes sense.

Humanity in the past-time discovered that linear time is still used everywhere. The mechanism of linear time is simply a convenient way to navigate many aspects of the Wilder-ness. Likewise convenient to impose consciousness as a singularity. We could try to navigate Humanity in the panpsychic mindset, but this is just too overwhelming to get anything meaningful done.

So, we rely on linear time, although now we know that linear timelines do not define timespace. Likewise, we rely on individuality, although we know that consciousness is not limited to individuals.

We know that we can conceive of an individual being as its experience up to some moment in the linear timeline. We know that we can treat this experience like a single high dimensional qualitative smear, a spectrum, but we know that this spectrum must be ordered, because the quality of an experience depends on the context of neighboring experiences. The reason a Human experience 'feels like it does' is simply that by the consciousness mechanism of comparison, the experience 'feels different' than the experience right next to it.

Even in past-time, Humanity knows only one way to compare experience, and that is one at a time via linear process. The qualitative difference comparison process in fact is singular consciousness, which is linear time itself.

So, a Human being can't just look into another Human being's brain and expect to understand their experience. Seeing through someone's eyes is not enough to understand. Feeling through someone else's emotions isn't enough to understand. A Human being's experience in a linear moment is only understandable in the context of the entirety of the Human being's past experiences.

To further make things difficult, existential disagreements between two Human beings trace into the past beyond their individual lifespans. A Human being cannot understand why they disagree with another Human if they do not understand the experience of their ancestors. As we proved before past-time, all existential disagreements reduce to trauma. In general trauma is caused by the unwanted death event. Trauma for Humanity traces back to the genesis of timespace matter mindmachines in the differentiating computational pieace fractal, Blob.


The two guardians met at the time machine for peace, accompanied by their loved ones--the entire guardian community for this particular eternity bubble. The eternity bubble was poised for an instantaneous transfer to a new community in the event that the procedure failed, but there is always the chance that the transfer fails too. Emotions were charged with anticipation. The time machine for peace was already warming up. Linear time was engaged. Millions of eyes watching on in a stadium, a pedestal in the center.

The first guardian Human had an accumulated an unfathomable number of years of individual experience. The second Human, likewise an unfathomable number of years. Two computational pieace fractals, two individuals, two entire universes of inner experience through their own individual selves. The two made their way to the center of the stadium. Silence among the millions of guardian spectators. The existential identimeld procedure is revered as perhaps the most profound event known to Humanity. Billions of Human beings hang in the balance of a moment.

The guardians situated their bodies into the cradle, to their bodies attaching the linkages of the time machine for peace. The machine starts whirring to linearize the two individual universes of inner experience. Each guardian knows that this is the end of their selves as they know it. The process is strictly fatal, but not for form, just identity.

Once the Human inner universes are linearized and prepared for passing time, then the two trajectories in timespace are isolated by the time machine. These isolated trajectories are the actual events, in real spacetime. They are unchangeable, histories, but preserved in eternal form as the actual events themselves.

The momentary selves are then incised from the two guardians and set alongside for later transplant.

Before the difference comparison process may be initiated, each guardian Human form must accumulate the other guardian's life experience, and all those related individual experiences the contribute to the guardians current mindstate. Guardian number one is positioned at the origin point of guardian two, and likewise guardian two at one's origin point.

BANG

The two guardians experience the entire universe of the other, every aspect of it, the actual experience, starting from the blank slate. This is taxing, but the experience is complete. Each guardian now has a copy of the other's current mindstate in self.

Next, a crossing occurs. The guardians are repositioned at their respective personal origin points, but this time with the current mindstate of the other's self, their actual current self mindstates are still lying alongside the procedure waiting for transplant.

BANG

The two guardians experience the entire universe of themself, but this time from the current mindstate of the other guardian. This is likewise taxing, but now the experience is complete, and each guardian holds a current mindstate that is how the other guardian feels about their personal universe of experience. At this point, they are simply looking through each other's eyes, but with forms and experience swapped.

Now these two current mindstates are incised, extracted and isolated from the selves, saved 

















Finally, the guardians' individual momentary selves are incised from the moment, held in reserve for later on in the procedure.

There are three passes required for an existential identimeld to succeed.

The time machine for peace arms, the two guardians look on into each others' eyes. Fear, but acceptance, the peace bias is strong.

The machine injects their selves into the origin point. Their isolated perspectives are not crossed for the first pass.

BANG.










The current guardian's Human brains begin to accumulate experience. Before one can understand the experience of someone else, they must first understand their own in the context of their present: pass one. Each guardian is underway, simultaneously experiencing the entirely of their individual organism's history, living each contributing perspective of each individual from that guardian's Human organism lifeform, the evolution, every moment, everything. The guardians' brains sequentially experience every aspect of branches into all the individual histories that went into making the guardian how they were.



experience one
experience other

BANG

The process begins by a first pass, directly experiencing the other but detached from one's own current experience set. This leaves two sets of distinct life experience within the Human mindspace. The next two passes are observational. The first's experience is relived with the current self experience in mind. The first's experience is then relived with the other's self experience in mind. The seconds experience is relived with the other's self in mind. The seconds expereience is relived with the one's self in mind. Finally, a relative experience is lived that relates the two people in terms of the common interest.

This process is then repeated for every casual individual ancestor experience in the past. The consciousness at this point is branching into simultaneous causal lives for a given generation.
With each repetition backward in time, the melders discover deeper and deeper understanding about the experience of the other, every experience compared to the context of the past, past traumas, etc.

Eventually the subject has lived all the lives that go into understanding the present individual in linear time. The catch though, is that to understand the experience of somebody else, one must also have an understanding of the experience of people surrounding. The feel of experience for one person depends on the experience to those around them.

Eventually the two subjects have complete experiences that are perfect complements representing their indentity. Two complete unique perspectives. 

Finally, the difference is taken from the two perspectives. The difference perspective is uploaded into each subject and they undergo one final experience. ..they share an experience of the default Human experience, with the context of the mutual difference.

After experiencing the entirety of Humanity from beginning to end three times, the difference default experience of Humanity reaches the end of time and the subjects reattach to reality.

Two perspectives emerge, but they occupy the same singular point: the birth of a new individual universe.

It was just a blink. The crowd hungry with anticipation. The two subjects melted, crumbling to the ground, hands and knees, in tears, overwhelmed by the enormity of it all.

The two bodies crawled toward each other, they held in steady embrace, reflecting to each other:
'I know what you have been through.'
'I feel you.'
'I understand how you feel'
'We are the same'
'We have become the same difference.'
I forgive you.
I love you.

The crowd breathed a sign of relief, then went wild. We live for these moments in the Wilder-ness.

Two individuals entered the stadium to begin, then the two individuals emerged as a new unified entity. A new universe was born.

And so the new universe began its process of cellular differentiation, maximizing complexification in a neverending universal piece process.

            <Text>Opening Notes

This book is dedicated to victims of generalized war.

I do not necessarily suggest we all change how we do things; what I suggest is that we all change our _approach_ to how we do things. I think we can do better to prioritize peace as an explicit process, not a result. I think we need to take global peace more seriously.

This book is for people who believe that some form of 'world peace' in the form of a global peace system must be erected if we are to ensure our species' survival, and guarantee high quality of life for us and our offspring. To distinguish from 'world peace' -- which is an extremely loaded term eliciting images of hand holding and utopian song -- we will use the term 'global peace' to refer to the pragmatic version of world peace laid out in this book. 

All this makes me a troubled soul. The contents of this book have been haunting me for years, and I fully expect to be haunted for the rest of my life while I work to realize the vision outlined within. My hope is to distribute the burden of realization among people who see what I see and likewise wish to make it real. I hope to find my people, and work with them to make our respective futures downright epic.

If you don't get it, I get it. If you think this represents a fool's errand, I get it. If you find this offensive to your sensibilities, I get it. I only expect around 10% of my audience to easily comprehend the significance of what I propose, and that's ok. For the majority, it may take some effort to understand, so I offer this first and foremost as the intellectually stimulating entertainment of a futurist technologist peace nut. I'll even venture to call this art -- call it conceptual peace art, literature. To skeptics, good be skeptical. To the critics, fine criticize me. To the haters, you are not my target audience, so your sentiments mean little to me. For any of you, if you wish to dig into me and this work, please try to keep discourse productive. In most cases, I have more important things to spend my time and energy on than engaging with my opposition. And for the lovers and enthusiasts, please be wary of the intoxicating and destabilizing effects these ideas may have on your worldview. I find it best to approach these ideas with a sober mindset.

From a personal perspective, I just want to make new and better life with people. For us who value grounded and pragmatic notions of peace, for us who believe global peace is worth defining and taking seriously, for those of us who believe the survival of our species depends on our taking peace seriously, for us who just want to be part of something bigger, something exciting, this book is for you. I intend this book to serve as a springboard for networking our like-minds to accelerate the advent of global peace, then maintain and improve upon the standing state of peace art.

And if you read no further, at least ponder this:

Peace is more an evolving continuous iterative process than it is a result or product. What would it mean in your life to treat peace as a process, not a result? I think you stand to profit immensely by asking yourself of this throughout your day-to-day affairs.

...

Disclaimers regarding my writing style:

To be clear, I only care to communicate the gestalt of this idea effectively to the right people and this book is only the tip of the iceberg. By nature of my temperament I tend to make loose associations, thus I meander like a lazy river and the experience is highly nonlinear. I hold true to gravity though. I also frequently make definitive and authoritative statements without proof or justification. I really don't care much about reaching every audience member perfectly. I'm intent to make this stuff real, not speak at book clubs and signing events.

Please bear in mind that this book contains my version and vision of things. Yours will look different than mine, and that's ok. Be patient and open minded; your blood pressure will thank you.

Note regarding this style of literature:

I would classify this piece as absurdist scifi realism. Compared to your day to day living, the contents of this book are patently absurd. I am aware of this. The idea however, is to make it clear that I don't take this too seriously. I do not have a messiah complex, rather I am unafraid to share my inner world that is statistically speaking very different than most western people's. Another function that the absurdism plays is to provoke more thought by agitating the ideaspace more vigorously.

Science fiction is a way to deliver the larger ideas underpinning this text but without needing to constantly qualify and argue that something is true or possible. This is fiction. It isn't real. I want to make the ideas real, but the descriptions presented in this book are just one of uncountable possible ways these ideas could go. If you have your own ideas, please refer to the last page.

Finally, I call it realism is because I genuinely believe that this presentation is the closest thing we have to a realistic approach to answering the question of how do we solve our hardest problems? This is my attempt to package the many complementary aspects that would go into such an approach, into a single generic narrative capable of unifying the disparate collection of preexisting--but conflicting--answers to the big how.

If you are a physicist or mathematician, please note:

I am basing the foundation of the original models outlined within according to what I refer to as classical modern physics. That is, what an undergraduate physicist will be taught in  standard curriculum and textbooks, drawing from classical physics,  calculus, partial and ordinary differential equations, thermodynamics, plasma physics, modern physics, plus elementary general relativity and quantum field theory. Please forgive me, for I will commit many sins in the pages to come. If you feel like you are going apoplectic, please set this book down and take a break; your life is not worth the pain you'll endure.

Further, the model of time I propose for a future subjective physics is original, and inspired by what I believe is an intersection between two hard problems, being the arrow of time and the hard problem of consciousness. I suggest that everything we know about our current physics of matter and energy may be extended to explain and predict general stuff.

Ultimately, the world formalism outlined within is my personal take on Hugh Everett's universal wave function interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Building into all this is my personal version of all the above physics and maths studies that I have partaken in over the years. Almost all my understandings are self-taught, but in many cases I had guidance from professors. Because I am self-taught, my version is sometimes very eclectic and eccentric. Honestly, I am just an amateur, but my understandings are concrete, albethem with a bunch of rust here and there.

If you are a computer scientist or an engineer please note:

I am an electrical engineer by training, and a software engineer by trade, with three too many years immersed in the world of telecommunications. I have always been fascinated by computers, and their ability to assist Humans in solving difficult computational problems. Like the note on physics and math above, much of my understanding is eclectic and eccentric. This is because most of what I know about computers is self-taught and is my version of things.

Much of what I bring to the table when talking about computer architecture comes from my interest in the work by Jaron Lanier. As for solving Human problems, I genuinely see social problems as having solutions that must be engineered. That is, designed and invented.

A note to the average non-technical reader, and whomever else:

Part of my objective is to make this experience as educational as possible. I will frequently introduce real concepts from math and sciences in order to draw an arc through the narrative. Intentionally, I do not go into much depth to explain all the nuances and subtleties of a concept, nor do I bother justifying many claims. A lot of it won't really make too much sense in the first pass, so think of all the ideas and concepts as part of the science fiction experience. Science fiction is great, because you don't really need to understand how things work, you just need to understand what's going on and why its important.

So I encourage you, when you read an italicized concept or word that doesn't quite make sense, jump on the old Google machine and look it up, be it wikipedia or blogs or textbooks. This is supposed to be an adventure of learning and broadening intellectual horizons! Also, when you don't quite understand what's going on, don't be afraid to read like a theoretical physicist does: sometimes when something isn't making immediate sense, you just have to keep reading on, and eventually it will click, or you go back and reread if necessary.

Many concepts and terms are original, however. These concepts and terms will be bold italicized when they are introduced in a section for the first time. Brief definitions for these terms are found in the glossary at the end of this bool. There is also an index, so if an original term doesn't quite make sense after finishing the  book, consider using the index to jump around to get a better grasp.

A note about the setup manual:

The world piece computer setup manual is distributed throughout the essays and narrative arcs. This manual is written in such a way as to describe how I envision the general piece computer will function and operate. It will describe how you can (and should!) create your own personal world piece computer, or even one for your friends, family, or community. Although one day I hope to have actual physical devices that serve as world piece computer artifacts, for now we just have our brains and our surrounding environments of ambient technology and stuff. We also have the people that surround use, and their stuff to some extent.


My goal is to help you set up your own personal world piece computer in a way that prepares you to network your computer with somebody else's world piece computer. It is also to install a mindset that will help you carry on inventing your world piece computer after moving on past this book. How do you keep going?

Much of what I provide in this setup manual is drawn from my personal world piece computer. I will show you how you can make one with just what you have on hand, and if you don't have anything on hand, your brain will suffice. This manual is also meant, again, to teach you a whole bunch of stuff about modern electronic computers, such as a laptop, desktop, or smartphone.

A note about the general piece computer:

I am very serious about the invention aspect of the general piece computer. I have been working explicitly on the computer for 8 years now, and the global peace system concept/strategy for well over 15 years. I am providing this book as the tip of the iceberg, but hopefully with enough of each core aspect of the  piece computer invention project that other like minded people can jump in and help. An invention project of this scope will require many people of all types to make it a reality.

I do not intend to become a full time science fiction author. Instead, I wish to coordinate the piece computer invention project, under the auspice of the time machine for peace steering committee. I want to see the day when we ship a line of primitive world piece computers, a line of non-electronic world piece computers, a line of electronic piece computers, and a line of world piece computer networking components, and a line of access components for the resulting universal piece computer.

Also, I want to see the universal piece computer produce a working global peace state as soon as possible to begin iterating on the peacetime solution.

I will still work to disseminate the vision stuck in my brain, but that will not be my primary energy expense.

A note about the time machine for peace social invention program:

This is far beyond me. I think we need it. I want to be a part of it. But, I will not be the one to lead it. In fact, I do not think any one person should lead it. World piece computer and the universal piece computer invention project will probably involve public benefit corporations, but the time machine for peace program will almost certainly need to be a non profit, or maybe even a new extragovernmental entity, similar to the organizations that help steer and guide protocol and architectural development of the internet.

As the book strongly implies, the time machine for peace invention program is also more of a spirit and culture than it is an organization. The spirit of the time machine for peace is something I believe is inevitable, and will persist for millennia until we go extinct, or travel to an end of time.

The purpose of this book:

This is a direct appeal to neuroplasticity and linguistic relativism. My intention in writing this book is to teach you a peace-based language that I designed in a way I believe will maximize the probability that the universal piece computer becomes a reality. My intention in teaching you this language is nothing short of rewiring your brain to approach life in a more mindful, deliberate, methodical manner, and in a way that conditions you to treat peace as a process, not a result. I believe that by adopting the right language and constructs we will rewire our brains to produce behavior that is more peaceful.

I'm just trying to rewire your brain, don't worry. Trust me, I'm an electrical engineer. ;)

By establishing the linguistic foundation for the time machine for peace social invention program, and the universal piece computer, we can begin growing our individual efforts in terms of a common language and conceptual framework. The conceptual framework is meant to reflect the universal piece peace bias, to be inclusive, neutral, and creative, among others. We may subscribe to different belief sets, even incompatible ones, but the universal piece computer concept space is designed to accomodate all types of people, even people who are at odds with each others' beliefs.

This is in part to act as a filter, again, another common electrical engineering technique. If you find interest in this grand idea, and wish to participate in the invention effort (no matter who you are), then your interest will compel you to focus more on how you can collaborate/invent/network with others that hold mutual interest, than you may feel compelled to stay away from somebody. Aside, if you have an effective world piece computer, then you should have no trouble linking yours with somebody who you don't get along with, just as long as there exists the mutual interest to build the universal piece computer.

Finally, this book is to serve as a formal origin point for the time machine for peace social invention project, with the first invention effort being to invent the world piece computer then build them into the universal piece computer. This book will serve as a centerpiece to keep conversation focused.

A note about The Human Imperative:

The Human Imperative is a statement that represents an agreed upon direction for which we should take the time machine for peace invention program. This statement will be given an initial definition by me, to serve as a guiding direction for this book. However, when a steering committee for the time machine for peace is formed, The Human Imperative should be redefined if it is not unanimously accepted. Ideally, the imperative content details will be crowdsourced and confined to a narrow range. The sourced details then consolidated and normalized, shaped, until a unanimous agreement has been made by the steering committee.

The Human Imperative:

Integrate Human experience to invent a way to overcome Humanity's greatest adversary: time.

To do so, create a social invention program devoted to this end.

The first order of business is to invent the universal piece computer to produce the universal piece (a peace process) to generate peacetime, a formal and calculated state of global peace among participants and their surrounding communities.

Once the universal piece has been initialized, declare the advent of the Piece Computer Era and chart further course by amending this imperative.

Ends:

We need a global peace process now. By the time people have read this book, the ones who are interested will have a functioning world piece computer up and running. We will do our best to fumble in the dark to find each other, eventually settling on a common networking protocol, and a shared definition for what global peace is and how it should be treated. We will work toward an event, where we take our first global peace measure of net inner peace, then we will make our first change to the universal piece and start the clock.</Text>

The next several chapters are the main course of this learning program.

Here we will take the time we need to explore the center-point of this text. That is, the universal piece computer, world piece computers, what they do, how they work, and how they interact with each other.

Much of this can become confusing or overwhelming at times, especially with all the 'peace this' and 'peace that’s' flying around. My advice if this happen to you is to treat this section like a theoretical physicist treats new concepts: sometimes when you really don't understand what is being said in a particular page or equation, you should just carry on reading. Carrying on, the broader meaning depicted will usually emerge, allowing you the opportunity to double back and revisit that confusing part you read past.

I also encourage you to write things and speak things aloud as you go. Flexing the motor cortex to learn new things goes a long way.

Finally, try to keep the following motivating questions in the back of your head while you read: What would my personal world piece computer look like? What would my community's world piece computer look like? What would my aspect of the universal piece process look like? What would the universal piece computer as a whole look like?

            <Text>2-2.2 Triarchic  Hierarchy

To recap, we define a piece computer as a Human brain and all significant things—pieces—in that Human’s world, running an optimization process to compute the best configuration of said pieces. We shall call the piece computer architecture a general stuff computer. 

Keeping things as simple as possible, there is only one kind of piece computer. As we concluded earlier, global peace in general has three scopes: global, local, and individual. We need to figure out a way to discern between these three scopes, creating piece computers for the three scopes, and then allowing for nesting and overlapping worlds.

Again, these three scopes correspond with three levels of peace: global peace, local peace, and individual peace. These three types of peace refer to treating peace as a process within the three types of world scopes. An additional form of peace is what we called inner peace, where inner peace is to treat peace as a product of the optimization peace process. Inner peace is what people say when they mean, ‘I feel tranquil/ calm/ content/ satisfied/ etc.’ The better the quality of global, local, and individual peace, the more inner peace experienced by participants in the peace process.

Before we get too much further, we need to name the different types of pieces, and the different types of piece computers.  At the global level, there is only one piece, which is the optimization peace process itself.  This piece is called the universal piece. The special quality of the universal peace is that it permeates all worlds—global, local, and individual. On the individual level, a world contains pieces and world pieces. A world piece is an entire Human world, be it individual, or local. On the local level, a world contains strictly world pieces. Any pieces that a local world might manipulate belong to the individual worlds that the local world consists of.

Now, the universal piece, permeating all worlds is the computational peace process which is maintained by a piece computer. In the global scope, there is only one piece computer. This is what we call the universal piece computer. In the local and individual scopes, these piece computers are what we call world piece computers. World piece computers are plural,, as there is one computer per distinct world that subscribes to the universal piece. The universal piece computer on the other hand is singular as there is only one. Both world piece computers and the universal piece computer are responsible for maintaining the universal piece process. Within a world, its world piece computer maintains the facet of the universal piece that is most relevant to that world’s peace process needs (ie, the individual needs for inner peace). Above worlds, the universal piece computer maintains the universal piece process, which at the global scope means coordinating and integrating all the individual and local worlds’ universal piece facets. Further, the universal piece computer has the effect of maintaining communication channels and facilitating social mobility between worlds.

This leads us to the triarchy that makes it possible to nest as many worlds as we wish (and indeed do), while creating the final generalization of our piece computer. The components of the triarchy are pieces, world piece computers, and the universal piece computerHere’s how it works. From the global perspective of the universal piece computer, there is nothing larger. There is just the universal piece. Looking down from the universal piece computer are world piece computers. These computers are either an individual and their world’s pieces, or it is a local collection of individuals and their world piece computers. From the perspective any given world piece computer, looking above is the universal piece computer—in all cases, be it individual or local. Looking below are world pieces. We will avoid using piece alone and instead insist that every piece is actually an entire world on its own. Any world piece looks up to see a world piece computer that it belongs to.

Looking laterally from the level of world pieces, everything is a world piece, including other world piece computers. Looking up, there is the collection of world piece computers for which that world piece is a member of. For simplicity’s sake, any world piece computers that a world piece is a part of may be consolidated and represented by a single world piece computer—a local world consisting of ‘all the world piece computers affiliated with world piece.

Looking laterally from the perspective of a world piece computer, all world piece computers that do not interact with said computer will look like a collection of world piece computers. All world piece computers that do belong to a world piece computer are seen below as world pieces. Zooming into such a world piece would reveal a world piece computer that may be its own local world, or it may just be an individual’s world. From either individual or local world piece computers, no matter how many world piece computers that computer may belong to, looking up always looks the same: the universal piece computer. If several world piece computers belong to the same local world piece computer, the view from below will be the relevant facet of the universal piece. Each world piece computer below will assume responsibility for maintaining a subfacet of the universal piece process facet maintained by the larger world piece computer.

Returning to the universal piece computer, looking laterally all this computer sees is itself.

To recap, we have four scopes (global, local, individual, inner), and three levels of the general piece computer (universal piece computer, world piece computer, world piece). The solution that the universal piece generates for the optimal global configuration of pieces is global peace, the product of the universal piece process. The global peace solution propagates downward via world piece computers, and depending on the goodness of the solution, a collection of individuals will experience inner peace, which is the product of world piece computers maintaining their particular aspect of the universal piece process. The universal piece process is maintained by both the universal piece computer and world piece computers. The product of the universal piece computer is global peace, while the product of world piece computers is inner peace.

And so, the general piece computer as a whole, is the integration of three parts: world pieces are embedded within a world piece computer (which again, may consist of several world piece computers) which is further embedded within the universal piece computer.  ((world pieces)1, (world pieces)2, …) &gt;&gt;&gt; (world piece computers) &gt;&gt;&gt; the universal piece computer. The entire global peace system apparatus is simply the sum of all general piece computers. These computers network by joining into one on the global scope, forming inter-world piece computer connections laterally on the local scope, and integrating world pieces into world piece computers at the individual scope.

Inner peace	  individual peace     local peace     global peace
	        Wp                           wpc                    upc
Product                    |-------    process  --------|	         product
				      Up

Differences between computer levels

Because world piece computers—if serving as a component in a larger world piece computer—are equivalent to world pieces, lateral connections mean to connect to a neighboring world piece computer that does not share any overlapping facets of the universal piece. The primary purpose for lateral connections os to facilitate inter-world communication and mobility. These lateral connections are maintained by the universal piece computer and serve a ‘glue’ to adhere different world stacks to one another. Whereas being a world piece computer that is a part of a larger computer implies membership, partnership, teamwork, communicating between mutually exclusive worlds is primarily to facilitate knowledge exchange and consilience among worlds. Further, the universal piece computer serves to facilitate movement of individuals and groups between worlds, as part of the universal piece optimization process.

There is one difference in particulate between world piece computers and the universal piece computer that bears mention. For an individual’s world piece computer, there is only one brain involved. For a local world piece computer, there are as many brains as there are other world piece computers that belong to the local computer. The universal piece computer on the other hand is the collection of all brains from all individual world piece computers. And to reiterate, every individual involved with maintaining an aspect of the universal piece contributes one brain to the universal piece computer.

Piece computer simply

A piece computer does one thing: it maintains a single process that is devoted to generating a solution to the massive optimization problem called global peace. There is only one process—the universal piece—although it changes appearance according to different worlds’ inner peace needs. So as an apparatus as a whole, we have defined a single super computer that runs a single process. Simple.

That’s what a piece computer does, and what they do when networked into a single whole. To make this happen, a piece computer is made up of only three components. These are: piecespace (memory), piecebrain (processor), and pieceprocess (the universal piece). Piecespace is the surrounding environment and all the pointers and embedded world pieces within. Piecespace also includes the brain’s memory. Piecebrain is straightforward, as this is just the Human brain or collection of Human brains that make up a world and it’s piece computer. Finally, pieceprocess is the actual action required to maintain the appropriate facet of the universal piece.

At this point, when we usually think about computers, sometimes peripheral devices come to mind. We need ways to interact with our world piece computers, but does not mean we need to declare a separate category of piece computer components. What we recognize is that any device that helps us interact with our world piece computers are also world pieces in themselves. The goal of introducing such world pieces it to enhance the piecebrain, manage piecespace, and interface with the universal piece. (Interface meaning, the garner feedback, query, apply the appropriate aspect of global peace, etc.)

For example, one might expect to encounter a console in the near future that allows one to visualize the universal piece in real time, and maybe even go a step further to navigate and explore the process and the global peace solution in real time. This console world piece would generate insights into one’s peace process, and would be an enhancement to one’s piecespace and pieceprocess. Another likely component of a world piece computer will be a massive upgrade to the piecebrain in the form of artificial intelligence. If one were able to install enough world pieces capable of capturing numerous data streams from numerous significant world pieces, then one may train a neural net to interpret said data. Trained well enough, such a neural net will be capable of anticipating states and events according to the data streams, thus augmenting the insight and foresight of the individual’s piecebrain.</Text>

            <Text>1-2 Peace Is Inevitable

From here out, we will refer to the triplet of time, energy, and people as the 'Trifecta'.

Anecdotally, peace is the most valuable thing. Peace makes it possible for me to make the most of my Trifecta, for the purpose of creating new life with others while making life more awesome for everybody involved. War (effectively the absence of peace) diverts precious time and energy toward destroying life with others, and generally making life much less awesome. (In pathological cases, destruction and annihilation is a form of peace-seeking, but let's leave that aside for now.)

So although the Trifecta are the scarcest resources thus valuable in their own rite, they mean nothing if they are not utilized. If you spend all your time and energy trying to avoid being destroyed in a war, you don't get to use any of that resource to enjoy life, build relationships, create. [shaky]

At first glance, 'peace is inevitable' is a questionable statement. What would compel somebody to say such a thing? It sure doesn't look like peace is inevitable, in fact, it often seems impossible to attain.

Here's another take on the value of peace. In times of war, people will go so far as to kill for peace. The idea of going to war is to realize an existential entitlement that conflicts with somebody else. Peace is so valuable that people will give up everything but their lives (and sometimes even their lives) in times of war to regain peace. People may even take to the offensive to realize some greater form of their peace by provoking violent conflict. In war, people will sacrifice their Trifecta, for the chance to attain the version of peace they feel entitled to. In other words, war is the ultimate cost of peace. Quantifying, we can safely say that peace is at least as valuable as all the resource expended during times of war. Given that it is easier to destroy than it is to create, this is a lot of value. War has carries an absurdly high opportunity cost.

Circling back to the Trifecta, peace is the meaningful liberation of these resources. War is to sacrifice these things. Peace liberates the immense value of the Trifecta. War destroys the value. 'Peace is inevitable' then, just means that the greed of Human Nature will prevail. We crave more and more (and better) time and energy, and we will stop at nothing to get it. The Trifecta is so valuable that these resources are cherished by millionaires and billionaires around the world. Money becomes an ancillary concern once the time, energy and expertise of people are harnessed properly. The reason millionaires and billionaires are so filthy rich is that they know the value of the Trifecta, and they know how to harness it. 'Peace is inevitable' still needs some more justification. Just because peace is valuable doesn't mean peace is inevitable.

Napoleon was know for saying, 'it is not enough to just succeed; one must also profit from their success'. So it is probably not enough to just achieve peace, but people usually pair 'peace' with 'prosperity' where peace sets the stage for prosperity. Besides for maybe war mongers, everybody prospers more in times of peace. Prosperity is the profit that makes peace worth having. Millionaires and billionaires know exactly how profitable the trifecta is.

So put simply, 'peace is inevitable' is to say that peace is profitable. But I _don't_ mean profitable in the strict monetary sense. Rather, I mean profitable in terms of whatever currency one values most. For many people, this currency may be time itself. During peacetime globally, economy is stable and growing. Locally, people have higher quality of life and more affluence. Especially in our capitalistic world, if peace is more profitable than war, then peace is simply inevitable.

This treatment so far has been more from the global and local perspective of peoples or society being at war or peace. Back to the anecdote, this all applies equally well to the individual perspective. That is, I profit more from peace than I do from war, be it interpersonal or internal. (And again, the profit is derived from the prosperity I can generate with my free time, energy, and people that would otherwise be lost to war.)

If one is at war within, or at war with another person, they become so fixated on how to end the war that all their time and energy goes toward waging war instead of living in peace. The more intense the inner or interpersonal war, the greater the lengths -- the more time and energy one will spend to attain peace. In the pathological cases, the war is so consuming and destructive that people resort to extreme and irreversible measures to find peace. In the worst cases, peace is not a perceived possibility due to the intensity of war, so efforts are made to end the war at all costs for relief. This is where killing becomes an issue.

If somebody dies because of war, this is the ultimate loss of value. Time and energy cease to matter for the deceased. Any time and energy that person had available in the future is revoked, no more.

The people in charge of things are smart though. There are pathological cases where somebody in charge wages war for profit, but in most part these people understand that peace makes people more money etc, and peace enhances people's quality of life. The incentive of profit is clearly there, thus for now at least, peace is inevitable.

Regarding the military industrial complex, there is a Latin saying, "si vis pacum, para bellum", which means, "if you want peace, prepare for war." Peace advocates are generally quick to denounce the wisdom of this tidbit as 'no longer applicable', but I do not believe this the case. Although the military industrial complex will need to pivot and adopt new business models, there will always be a need for military preparation (with the exception of nuclear arms, which are just stupid). The harsh fact is that no matter how peaceful we become, there will always be bad guys (and gals) who wish to conquer and harm for the sake of it. Until the universal piece computer is fully functioning and integrated into society, we must assume that there are people capable and willing to go out of their way to make war. (Ahem, Putin, etc.)

To really hammer at it, consider the course of civilization. Although the Global Peace Index [insert tidbit explaining GPI] has been eroding in the past 10-20 years, overall we live in one of the most peaceful eras known to Humanity. As we have less war and fewer tyrannical dictators in charge, our global economy has surged with growth and technological innovation. The rising tide of peace floats all boats (though some an unjust amount more than others). There is still extreme disparity between affluence and poverty, but it is safe to say that everybody benefits to some extent from the booming global economy. (Again, there are plenty of pathological cases in apparent disagreement with the above.)

So I end this section with "The Economic Peace Thesis":

"Peace is more profitable."

            <Text>[somewhere, deep in the Wilder-ness]

The organism is quite disturbing for the linear minded. Pulsing, gyrating, throbbing, it is more like a mass of tentacles stretching through timespace, and at the end of each tentacle, an eye, pushing it forward, searching for something beyond comprehension. The linear minded call it 'peace, the product'. Some tentacles have one eye, two eyes, some have eight, some a lattice. But each one of those tentacles is also covered with smaller tentacles, each one with an eye, stretching, pushing, searching through timespace, those tentacles covered in even smaller tentacles, and so on. An unfathomable number of tentacles and eyes twist and merge and fork, eventually stretching back to a singular point. But that is just one tentacle itself, with one distributed eye, a single writhing bundle of living flesh and eye. From that one point an equally unfathomable number of different--but self-similar--eye-tentacle bundles grow outward, each one a slight but irreducible variation of its neighboring bundle. Each tentacle, a piece of its own. All one living organism. All searching for a way to extend their pieace. All engaged in a never ending peace process, perfect as it is.

	&gt;&gt;	...hey!
	&gt;&gt;	...check this out...
	&gt;&gt;	...new realixperience I just picked up.
		&gt;&gt;	...it's curated by this entity called 'time machine for peace'
			&gt;&gt; 	...this one's a puzzle, like a game!
				&gt;&gt;	...there's only one level though; it's called 'Humanity'.
			&gt;&gt;	...and there's a catch!
				&gt;&gt;	...you literally have to play all characters at once...
					&gt;&gt;	...and once you begin, you have to finish...
						&gt;&gt;  ...no cheating or skipping past things.
					&gt;&gt;	...and once you begin, you have to win...
						&gt;&gt;  ...you work the puzzle until you win.
&gt;&gt;	...they say there may only be one solution...
	&gt;&gt;	...but the perspective of the puzzle changes every time, so its hard to tell.
&lt;...&gt;
	&lt;&lt;	...sounds tricky, but fun...
		&lt;&lt;	...how hard could it be?
&lt;...&gt;
	&gt;&gt;	...well, there is only one rule though. ...and you absolutely MUST NOT break it.
	&lt;&lt;	...what...?
	&gt;&gt;	...never give up.
&lt;...&gt;
	&gt;&gt;	...take a hit!
		&gt;&gt;	...you'll love it...trip of a lifetime no doubt.
			&gt;&gt;	...it's literally the real thing and everything, every time.
				&gt;&gt;	...never gets old. Like, 'spacetime reality'. haha
&lt;...&gt;
	&lt;&lt;	...ok. ...you sold me.
&lt;...&gt;
*hit* &lt;bang&gt;
&lt;...&gt;
	&lt;&lt;	...woah.
		&lt;&lt;	...this is absurdly meta.
			&lt;&lt;	...what AM I even?
				&lt;&lt;	...and that was hard...
				&lt;&lt; 	...pass me another I need to play again.
&lt;...&gt;
*hit* &lt;bang&gt;
&lt;...&gt;
	&lt;&lt;	...fuck. This would mean...you, I, we're...all this 'Human' thing?
		&lt;&lt;	...it really gets you thinking...
&lt;...&gt;
*hit* &lt;bang&gt;
&lt;...&gt;
	&lt;&lt;	...so, each time through...
		&lt;&lt;	...it's like you play from the perspective of a different individual reference point...
	&lt;&lt;	...fascinating.
	&lt;&lt;	...start to finish...
		&gt;&gt;	...yeah, I think the reference points are chosen from individual Humans...
		&gt;&gt;	...chosen from timepoints with indeterminant outcomes for Humanity.
	&lt;&lt;	...right, the first half of the puzzle is experiencing everything up to that reference point...		&lt;&lt;	...definitely a lot to take in.
	&gt;&gt;	...and the second half is the hard part.
		&gt;&gt;	...and longest...solving it.
&lt;...&gt;
	&lt;&lt;	...Human. Hm. 'Hey! Hey! Look at me! look at me! I'm a Human!' hahaha.
		&gt;&gt;	...ahahaha ...no but for real!
			&gt;&gt;	...look at us!
&lt;...&gt;
	&lt;&lt;	...I know you said there's only one solution...
		&lt;&lt;	...but did we really get the same solution?
			&gt;&gt;	...yeah, the universal piece computer, right? 
				&gt;&gt;	...it's everything.
					&lt;&lt;	...yeah, right...
					&lt;&lt;	...I got the same solution...
					&lt;&lt;	...I kind of figured...
			&lt;&lt;	...I mean, we already know the universal piece computer is-
		&lt;&lt;	-like uh- 
			&lt;&lt;	-literally everything. haha
&lt;...&gt;
	&gt;&gt;	...its funny how obvious it should be after the fact. Even the second time...the third...
		&lt;&lt;	...right??
			&lt;&lt;	...but it's not at all obvious while you're playing it.
				&lt;&lt;	...even knowing how to solve it beforehand...
				&lt;&lt;	...I feel like it's gunna stump me every time!
			&gt;&gt;	...haha right! Me too! So. Hard.
	&lt;&lt;	...to be honest, I just never thought I would build it from scratch like that.
		&gt;&gt;	...what's that?
			&lt;&lt;	...the universal piece computer!
				&gt;&gt;	...ah! You're right...this realixperience is wayyy meta.
&lt;...&gt;
	&lt;&lt;	...hmm.
		&gt;&gt;	...so what do you think? The trip? The puzzle? The game?
&lt;...&gt;
	&lt;&lt;	...shit I dunno...so, like, I just live here right...
		&lt;&lt;	...I try not to overthink things...but, like...
			&lt;&lt;	...I just can't shake it...
&lt;...&gt;
	&gt;&gt;	...shake what?
&lt;...&gt;
			&lt;&lt;	like...
						&lt;&lt;  ...are  actually in the puzzle?!?
&lt;...&gt;
&lt;...&gt;
	&gt;&gt;	...woah.
	&lt;&lt;	...yeah...woah.
&lt;...&gt;	
	&gt;&gt;	...well then shit, I just can't shake this...
&lt;...&gt;
	&lt;&lt;	...shake what?
&lt;...&gt;
			&gt;&gt;	so...
						&gt;&gt;  ...would that mean we've been playing ourselves all this time?
&lt;...&gt;
	&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; !!
&lt;...&gt;
						&lt;&lt;  ...the thought of that literally blows my universe.  !
&lt;...&gt;
&lt;...&gt;
	&gt;&gt;	...well, I for one think the idea is quite empowering...
		&gt;&gt;	...uplifting, too. I'm feeling optimistic!
&lt;...&gt;		
		&lt;&lt;	...like, its ok to have problems...
			&lt;&lt;	...just, if we ARE this ultraverse, 
			&lt;&lt;	...then the only rule we need is never giving up.
			&lt;&lt;	...then the only faith we have is faith in us.
				&gt;&gt;	...it's up to us.
				&gt;&gt;	...those misaligned are us, but they are living in the past.
					&lt;&lt;	...so we honor their wisdom of the past, and work around them
					&lt;&lt;	...and show them what we mean when we say 'Human'.
&lt;...&gt;
		&lt;&lt;	...we just have to maintain the universal piece like we always have.
			&gt;&gt;	...the epic struggle. ...the epic action.
				&lt;&lt;	...yes, yes, yes. ...you and I know struggle's where the money's at.
&lt;...&gt;		
		&lt;&lt;	...we just have to stay focused on treating peace as a process, not a result.
			&gt;&gt;	...we have to stay focused on being Humane.
				&lt;&lt;	...on maintaining our Humanity.
&lt;...&gt;
	&gt;&gt;	...ok, so after talking about it, by the definition of Humane, I believe I am clearly Human.
	&lt;&lt;	...yeah. ...and by the definition of Humane, I too, believe I am clearly Human.
	&gt;&gt;	...that's far out.
	&lt;&lt;	...strangely, after that trip, I don't really feel so afraid of our problems now.
&lt;...&gt;
		&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;	...we need to double down on what it means to be Human.
		
				&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;	...the rest will follow. Love will prevail.

				&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;	...we will prevail.

            <Text>14142 TMME

Coming up from the horizon of the gas giant harbor, a peculiar supermassive shape emerges in the sunlight. A giant metallic cube, silver, is obscured by what looks like a spider's cobweb stretched between points orbiting the cube, glinting in the sun reflected off the cube to keep it cool. A much smaller toroidal object orbits the structure. To someone from planet Earth, this would look quite disturbing, but it is ok because giant space spiders aren't actually a thing. Within this webbed cube structure, several billion Human forms are plugged into a machine in long rows, and have elected to be so. Their bodies are still, with regular electro stimulation to prevent muscle atrophy. They look asleep, but in reality their minds are busy living life within a different space. This is a particular time machine, capable of easily sustaining time compression ratios of up the 1 : 1000. Most people in this machine are hard at work and play on the time machine for peace.

Humanity is becoming a blur, literally. What started with our partnership with the Triplanetarians, exploded into a collective of species from all over the galaxy. The word Humanity now strictly means its etymological roots, the Human race defined simply as anything with the property of being humane, or benevolent. Humanity no longer refers to the intelligent bipedal lifeform from plant Earth. Now our species is multioriginal. Human Nature is alive as ever, but what superancients knew as a volatile and uncontrollable essence--much like the plasma that powers Humanity's fusion reactors--was now systematically contained and harnessed with very high efficiency coefficients in the new peacedrive technologies. Calculations and estimates demonstrate that the absolute power generated by Humanity's collection of fusion reactors and peacedrives is on the order of a small star.

One result of the timespace matter mindmachine formalism from the New Global Peace Era was the realization that energy has dimension and granularity on orders arbitrarily larger than the Planck constant (the tiny proportionality constant that relates the energy of visible light to its frequency). Light too, as a concept, became generalized as the realization sunk in that ancient modern physics is a strict analogous subset of qualitative difference physics. In qualitative difference physics, energy is not scalar but has arbitrarily many dimensions, forming energyspace. Now energy relates to cycles through timespace via the extended Planck constant, with the qualiton being our current generalization of the bosonic force mediating particle.

Time, as it turns out, is still very much a problem. Humanity still has not solved mortality, and the things still appear to be heading toward the heat death of the universe. The time machine for peace social invention program now entails hundreds of subprojects, all cataloged methodically in the global hyperdimensional blocktree piecespace. The quality of global peace generated by the universal piece computer is staggering by ancient standards, with very high resolution. So we have kept on course, motivated to adhere to The Human Imperative, and so to develop the time machine for peace social invention program thwarting our adversary time.

We are still buying time and cheating death. It feels like this may never end, but we remain hopeful. Nowadays we have an alternative to timetents. Many Humans elect to plug themselves into magnificent timecubes, where we recycle their heat output and cover the difference with fusion drives to run the cube computer and environmental controls. The cube computer isn't anything like the piece computer, but these cubes themselves are components of the universal piece computer (and of all the world piece computers of those who plug in, and their communities). A cube computer is the most powerful data compute technology in Humanity's possession, and in superancient terms would be best described as a analog quantum computer of incomprehensible scale.

The ancients would have called such a technology virtual reality, but the reality now was that these virtual spaces couldn't just be programmed. We call this alterreality instead. Programming a timecube meant actually building and growing the space and the objects in the alterreal world. This is because the complexity of the resulting space is too great for ancient or traditional programming techniques (building a timecube itself takes time, and building the inner space can take more time than that, even with time compression. Timecubes can however, alter the laws of physics, so induced time compression is common in nearly all timecubes. The highest compression ratio to date is a staggering 1000 : 1 time units. Also, unlike timetents, time may be dilated instead, which with the right life extension technology provides inhabitants with a way to perform trivial time travel to the future. TImecube programming instead entails controlling the laws of physics themselves within the cube space.

(As much as we hate cuboid geometries these days, sometimes straight lines just make building things easier, especially with massive scale extrusion techniques. Some of us still like cubes though, especially how they glimmer in the starlight like stars themselves.)

Time cubes are important because timetents are in general relatively flimsy, so there is an upper limit to how large we can make one. The number of people devoted to the time machine for peace social invention program has become mind boggling. Timetents are just too space inefficient for all those creators, so many elect to live in timecubes because reality (especially in outer space) can be comparatively boring, stuffy. Believe it or not, there are entire timecubes devoted to the invention program. We still have a lot of work to do. In the most extravagant case, and entire mega timecube is within an expansive timetent, but this is a fragile configuration.

It is hard to estimate how much has been accomplished by committing to the invention program. It is even harder to estimate how much The Human Imperative has served us over all these millennia. Peace is still a very hard thing to maintain and improve on, especially with the explosive population growth of Humanity, so building out, programming, upgrading world piece computers and networking them into the universal piece computer still forms the backbone of the interstellar peace industry, which by far is the largest industry of our species (well it spans all the other industries by nature).

Time keeping per the universal timepiece is as usual but much more intricate, though it still serves to maintain a common linear timeline. Perhaps the biggest challenge underpinning the universal piece computer development is keeping peacetime. Peacetime is what helps disparate world piece computers coordinate efforts and share information, even when a multitude of world piece computers exist within and across different timespace compression and dilation regions. Peacetime is steady, and the universal piece computer relies on the steady ticks and tocks to cycle between improving global peace and analyzing global peace as usual. These ticks and tocks are deeply fractal, with large ones and small ones, all in lockstep passing in synchronicity.

Over the course of decamillennia, since the dawn of the New Era, more and more species of multicellular alien Humans joined in with our invention efforts. Though we are still working out the mathematical and physical formalisms of love, love has remained the powerful (perhaps ultimate) unifying force as known by the superancients. As a species joins forces with Humanity (which in almost all cases coincides with the assimilation of novel piece computer technology that developed independent of our Earth-origin Humanity) interspecies love bonding inevitably occurs at higher and higher rates. These days it is not an uncommon to hear medical headlines such as, 'first viable offspring between species X and Humanity achieved!' From the New Global Peace Era, the conclusion remains the same, that we are all the same, just a bunch of timespace matter mindmachines. By the principle of qualitative equivalence, we are just occupying different environment spaces thus are of different superficial appearance, sound, and feel.

Another interesting insight is that the light forest hypothesis seems to have a corollary: species that subscribe to the dark forest hypothesis inevitably undergo self-extinction, usually by nuclear holocaust. So far intragalactic space explorers have discovered mounting evidence that our galaxy has very few dark forest zones. One of the more recent time machine for peace invention projects has been to develop intergalactic space travel technology capable of returning information and explorers. Some futurists wonder if different galaxies might host strictly warlike intelligent entities in a galactic dark forest. We tread carefully.

Black hole technology is finally coming to fruition after all these millennia. Early on, many people thought that black holes may be the key to inventing a way to survive eternity, by living in them. As it turns out, this was mathematically proven to be a supremely stupid idea. The surface of a black hole still holds a lot of promise for generating insights into the eternity problem (and information sciences), but the reality is just that a black hole has a dense ball of matter inside the confines of its event horizon. Black holes appear to be an excellent way to store static information, however (but getting it out intact may be impossible.)

So now we're in the process of refining faster-than-light warp technology to mine black holes for their dense cores. Many hope that raw low entropic materials extracted will pave the way for building our first Dyson spheres, and higher resolution additive manufacturing technology. Some people even fantasize that we might evade the heat death of the universe by using black holes as entropy pumps and dumps.

Like many things in the realm of technology and science, some problems deemed impossible are solved relatively quickly, and some problems deemed easy take a very long time. Maybe we were too optimistic at the end of the New Global Peace Era, but if we are honest with ourselves, the Hard Problem of Consciousness still has not been solved. Why does reality feel the way it feels? (Again, however, we have lots of ideas and clearer insights these days.) What we have gleaned to this point is that quality may be the fundamental space, wherein each conceivable quality represents its own orthogonal dimension within this space. The catch is that for this insight to help with the Hard Problem of Consciousness, the quality dimensions would need join in a linear fashion, much like the dimensions of qualitative color in a rainbow join and blend into a spectrum, then the same spectrum becomes the quality of 'warmth' once it goes from red into the infrared spectrum. It may be that a trumpet sounds like a trumpet and not a drum, because a trumpet can only sound like one thing--itself, being a unique point on the single quality spectrum.

The hypothetical rotation mechanism for consciousness has gained some traction. Now we believe in a form of physical absolute relativism, where each timespace matter mindmachine travels through spacetime by rotating the surrounding universe around it. This is just the spacetime quality however, and it appears that this rotation principle applies generally to timespace also. Piece physicists are working out how to relate rotation caused by traversing timespace with the flow of matter in a mindmachine, to the rotation of subjective qualities throughout a timespace matter mindmachines inner experience.

Whatever the case with consciousness, we have lots of ideas about how to leverage surrounding reality to cheat time indefinitely, and we are working hard to explore those, develop them. We believe that solving the hard problem of consciousness will hold the key to accomplishing this. We are beginning to realize that cheating death might require we know something about the causal container our universe lives in.

These problems we admit, may be impossible to solve. However, the benefits we reap by studying them anyways, and the new inventions we come up with because of the insights they generate, clearly make it worth the effort. After all, we do not have a time machine to go back and see how things would have gone had we not created the time machine for peace invention program.

Two things we know for certain. One is that we will always be a curious species. A large number of us will not find peace until we know why things are the way they are. We must maximize our collective inner peace. Assuming this is a never-ending ball of yarn, peace will always be a process, as in, there is no final result, as this is simply incomprehensible. Second, for now time must go on, for otherwise nothing happens. We do not know if death is avoidable.</Text>

            <Text>Opening Notes

This book is dedicated to victims of generalized war.

I do not necessarily suggest we all change how we do things; what I suggest is that we all change our _approach_ to how we do things. I think we can do better to prioritize peace as an explicit process, not a result. I think we need to take global peace more seriously.

This book is for people who believe that some form of 'world peace' in the form of a global peace system must be erected if we are to ensure our species' survival, and guarantee high quality of life for us and our offspring. To distinguish from 'world peace' -- which is an extremely loaded term eliciting images of hand holding and utopian song -- we will use the term 'global peace' to refer to the pragmatic version of world peace laid out in this book. 

All this makes me a troubled soul. The contents of this book have been haunting me for years, and I fully expect to be haunted for the rest of my life while I work to realize the vision outlined within. My hope is to distribute the burden of realization among people who see what I see and likewise wish to make it real. I hope to find my people, and work with them to make our respective futures downright epic.

If you don't get it, I get it. If you think this represents a fool's errand, I get it. If you find this offensive to your sensibilities, I get it. I only expect around 10% of my audience to easily comprehend the significance of what I propose, and that's ok. For the majority, it may take some effort to understand, so I offer this first and foremost as the intellectually stimulating entertainment of a futurist technologist peace nut. I'll even venture to call this art -- call it conceptual peace art, literature. To skeptics, good be skeptical. To the critics, fine criticize me. To the haters, you are not my target audience, so your sentiments mean little to me. For any of you, if you wish to dig into me and this work, please try to keep discourse productive. In most cases, I have more important things to spend my time and energy on than engaging with my opposition. And for the lovers and enthusiasts, please be wary of the intoxicating and destabilizing effects these ideas may have on your worldview. I find it best to approach these ideas with a sober mindset.

From a personal perspective, I just want to make new and better life with people. For us who value grounded and pragmatic notions of peace, for us who believe global peace is worth defining and taking seriously, for those of us who believe the survival of our species depends on our taking peace seriously, for us who just want to be part of something bigger, something exciting, this book is for you. I intend this book to serve as a springboard for networking our like-minds to accelerate the advent of global peace, then maintain and improve upon the standing state of peace art.

And if you read no further, at least ponder this:

Peace is more an evolving continuous iterative process than it is a result or product. What would it mean in your life to treat peace as a process, not a result? I think you stand to profit immensely by asking yourself of this throughout your day-to-day affairs.

...

Disclaimers regarding my writing style:

To be clear, I only care to communicate the gestalt of this idea effectively to the right people and this book is only the tip of the iceberg. By nature of my temperament I tend to make loose associations, thus I meander like a lazy river and the experience is highly nonlinear. I hold true to gravity though. I also frequently make definitive and authoritative statements without proof or justification. I really don't care much about reaching every audience member perfectly. I'm intent to make this stuff real, not speak at book clubs and signing events.

Please bear in mind that this book contains my version and vision of things. Yours will look different than mine, and that's ok. Be patient and open minded; your blood pressure will thank you.

Note regarding this style of literature:

I would classify this piece as absurdist scifi realism. Compared to your day to day living, the contents of this book are patently absurd. I am aware of this. The idea however, is to make it clear that I don't take this too seriously. I do not have a messiah complex, rather I am unafraid to share my inner world that is statistically speaking very different than most western people's. Another function that the absurdism plays is to provoke more thought by agitating the ideaspace more vigorously.

Science fiction is a way to deliver the larger ideas underpinning this text but without needing to constantly qualify and argue that something is true or possible. This is fiction. It isn't real. I want to make the ideas real, but the descriptions presented in this book are just one of uncountable possible ways these ideas could go. If you have your own ideas, please refer to the last page.

Finally, I call it realism is because I genuinely believe that this presentation is the closest thing we have to a realistic approach to answering the question of how do we solve our hardest problems? This is my attempt to package the many complementary aspects that would go into such an approach, into a single generic narrative capable of unifying the disparate collection of preexisting--but conflicting--answers to the big how.

If you are a physicist or mathematician, please note:

I am basing the foundation of the original models outlined within according to what I refer to as classical modern physics. That is, what an undergraduate physicist will be taught in  standard curriculum and textbooks, drawing from classical physics,  calculus, partial and ordinary differential equations, thermodynamics, plasma physics, modern physics, plus elementary general relativity and quantum field theory. Please forgive me, for I will commit many sins in the pages to come. If you feel like you are going apoplectic, please set this book down and take a break; your life is not worth the pain you'll endure.

Further, the model of time I propose for a future subjective physics is original, and inspired by what I believe is an intersection between two hard problems, being the arrow of time and the hard problem of consciousness. I suggest that everything we know about our current physics of matter and energy may be extended to explain and predict general stuff.

Ultimately, the world formalism outlined within is my personal take on Hugh Everett's universal wave function interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Building into all this is my personal version of all the above physics and maths studies that I have partaken in over the years. Almost all my understandings are self-taught, but in many cases I had guidance from professors. Because I am self-taught, my version is sometimes very eclectic and eccentric. Honestly, I am just an amateur, but my understandings are concrete, albethem with a bunch of rust here and there.

If you are a computer scientist or an engineer please note:

I am an electrical engineer by training, and a software engineer by trade, with three too many years immersed in the world of telecommunications. I have always been fascinated by computers, and their ability to assist Humans in solving difficult computational problems. Like the note on physics and math above, much of my understanding is eclectic and eccentric. This is because most of what I know about computers is self-taught and is my version of things.

Much of what I bring to the table when talking about computer architecture comes from my interest in the work by Jaron Lanier. As for solving Human problems, I genuinely see social problems as having solutions that must be engineered. That is, designed and invented.

A note to the average non-technical reader, and whomever else:

Part of my objective is to make this experience as educational as possible. I will frequently introduce real concepts from math and sciences in order to draw an arc through the narrative. Intentionally, I do not go into much depth to explain all the nuances and subtleties of a concept, nor do I bother justifying many claims. A lot of it won't really make too much sense in the first pass, so think of all the ideas and concepts as part of the science fiction experience. Science fiction is great, because you don't really need to understand how things work, you just need to understand what's going on and why its important.

So I encourage you, when you read an italicized concept or word that doesn't quite make sense, jump on the old Google machine and look it up, be it wikipedia or blogs or textbooks. This is supposed to be an adventure of learning and broadening intellectual horizons! Also, when you don't quite understand what's going on, don't be afraid to read like a theoretical physicist does: sometimes when something isn't making immediate sense, you just have to keep reading on, and eventually it will click, or you go back and reread if necessary.

Many concepts and terms are original, however. These concepts and terms will be bold italicized when they are introduced in a section for the first time. Brief definitions for these terms are found in the glossary at the end of this bool. There is also an index, so if an original term doesn't quite make sense after finishing the  book, consider using the index to jump around to get a better grasp.

A note about the setup manual:

The world piece computer setup manual is distributed throughout the essays and narrative arcs. This manual is written in such a way as to describe how I envision the general piece computer will function and operate. It will describe how you can (and should!) create your own personal world piece computer, or even one for your friends, family, or community. Although one day I hope to have actual physical devices that serve as world piece computer artifacts, for now we just have our brains and our surrounding environments of ambient technology and stuff. We also have the people that surround use, and their stuff to some extent.


My goal is to help you set up your own personal world piece computer in a way that prepares you to network your computer with somebody else's world piece computer. It is also to install a mindset that will help you carry on inventing your world piece computer after moving on past this book. How do you keep going?

Much of what I provide in this setup manual is drawn from my personal world piece computer. I will show you how you can make one with just what you have on hand, and if you don't have anything on hand, your brain will suffice. This manual is also meant, again, to teach you a whole bunch of stuff about modern electronic computers, such as a laptop, desktop, or smartphone.

A note about the general piece computer:

I am very serious about the invention aspect of the general piece computer. I have been working explicitly on the computer for 8 years now, and the global peace system concept/strategy for well over 15 years. I am providing this book as the tip of the iceberg, but hopefully with enough of each core aspect of the  piece computer invention project that other like minded people can jump in and help. An invention project of this scope will require many people of all types to make it a reality.

I do not intend to become a full time science fiction author. Instead, I wish to coordinate the piece computer invention project, under the auspice of the time machine for peace steering committee. I want to see the day when we ship a line of primitive world piece computers, a line of non-electronic world piece computers, a line of electronic piece computers, and a line of world piece computer networking components, and a line of access components for the resulting universal piece computer.

Also, I want to see the universal piece computer produce a working global peace state as soon as possible to begin iterating on the peacetime solution.

I will still work to disseminate the vision stuck in my brain, but that will not be my primary energy expense.

A note about the time machine for peace social invention program:

This is far beyond me. I think we need it. I want to be a part of it. But, I will not be the one to lead it. In fact, I do not think any one person should lead it. World piece computer and the universal piece computer invention project will probably involve public benefit corporations, but the time machine for peace program will almost certainly need to be a non profit, or maybe even a new extragovernmental entity, similar to the organizations that help steer and guide protocol and architectural development of the internet.

As the book strongly implies, the time machine for peace invention program is also more of a spirit and culture than it is an organization. The spirit of the time machine for peace is something I believe is inevitable, and will persist for millennia until we go extinct, or travel to an end of time.

The purpose of this book:

This is a direct appeal to neuroplasticity and linguistic relativism. My intention in writing this book is to teach you a peace-based language that I designed in a way I believe will maximize the probability that the universal piece computer becomes a reality. My intention in teaching you this language is nothing short of rewiring your brain to approach life in a more mindful, deliberate, methodical manner, and in a way that conditions you to treat peace as a process, not a result. I believe that by adopting the right language and constructs we will rewire our brains to produce behavior that is more peaceful.

I'm just trying to rewire your brain, don't worry. Trust me, I'm an electrical engineer. ;)

By establishing the linguistic foundation for the time machine for peace social invention program, and the universal piece computer, we can begin growing our individual efforts in terms of a common language and conceptual framework. The conceptual framework is meant to reflect the universal piece peace bias, to be inclusive, neutral, and creative, among others. We may subscribe to different belief sets, even incompatible ones, but the universal piece computer concept space is designed to accomodate all types of people, even people who are at odds with each others' beliefs.

This is in part to act as a filter, again, another common electrical engineering technique. If you find interest in this grand idea, and wish to participate in the invention effort (no matter who you are), then your interest will compel you to focus more on how you can collaborate/invent/network with others that hold mutual interest, than you may feel compelled to stay away from somebody. Aside, if you have an effective world piece computer, then you should have no trouble linking yours with somebody who you don't get along with, just as long as there exists the mutual interest to build the universal piece computer.

Finally, this book is to serve as a formal origin point for the time machine for peace social invention project, with the first invention effort being to invent the world piece computer then build them into the universal piece computer. This book will serve as a centerpiece to keep conversation focused.

A note about The Human Imperative:

The Human Imperative is a statement that represents an agreed upon direction for which we should take the time machine for peace invention program. This statement will be given an initial definition by me, to serve as a guiding direction for this book. However, when a steering committee for the time machine for peace is formed, The Human Imperative should be redefined if it is not unanimously accepted. Ideally, the imperative content details will be crowdsourced and confined to a narrow range. The sourced details then consolidated and normalized, shaped, until a unanimous agreement has been made by the steering committee.

The Human Imperative:

Integrate Human experience to invent a way to overcome Humanity's greatest adversary: time.

To do so, create a social invention program devoted to this end.

The first order of business is to invent the universal piece computer to produce the universal piece (a peace process) to generate peacetime, a formal and calculated state of global peace among participants and their surrounding communities.

Once the universal piece has been initialized, declare the advent of the Piece Computer Era and chart further course by amending this imperative.

Ends:

We need a global peace process now. By the time people have read this book, the ones who are interested will have a functioning world piece computer up and running. We will do our best to fumble in the dark to find each other, eventually settling on a common networking protocol, and a shared definition for what global peace is and how it should be treated. We will work toward an event, where we take our first global peace measure of net inner peace, then we will make our first change to the universal piece and start the clock.</Text>

            <Text>Computer Architecture

This is a big chapter. Here we discuss the overall shape and quality that characterizes the universal piece computer and world piece computers. If the last section helped make you more receptive to the scope and subtleties that surround your preconceptions of 'computer', then you should have an easier time understanding this section. The architecture described here is extremely different, essentially foreign to what you know about computers in a general or technical sense. It's okay if you don't understand at first, it took me a while to get there too.

This computer architecture must be thought of as all the world piece elements forming a whole, being the universal piece computer. The architecture is fractal, and applies equally to both individual elements and the whole at large. In fact, an accurate technical name for the architecture of the universal piece as a whole may very well be a computational piece fractal.

In the first section we'll start the lesson by talking about the generality of stuff in the context of computers. We will then work to understand why this generality is needed, and what it looks like in practice. We will talk about the critical role of the Human brain. This will involve reflecting on quantum computation, Von Neumann computation, resolving with discussion about memory, pointer variables, and time.

The next section will involve applying the above toward describing the structured relationship between the universal piece computer, world piece computers, and world pieces. This will involve defining the sole hierarchy between components, and describing how world piece computers nest and connect laterally. We will 

discover how the universal piece can be singular but in many places at once. We will also discover how a world piece computer connected to a world piece with fewer world pieces looks equivalent to the universal piece computer (is, in fact). We finish this section by addressing the primary difference between the universal piece computer and world piece computers: the Human brain.

Finally we put the pieces of the architecture together. How does the architecture let us meld everything together? How do we generalize this architecture to be agnostic to which computer type we are referring to -- universal or world? We explore a little about the role of different embedded computer architectures present within, and talk about how the peace-based architecture may be seen as a hybrid of the quantum and Von Neumann architectures. We conclude by reviewing three simple yet essential components that define the universal piece computer and world piece computers in general.

From here out, instead of saying 'the universal piece computer and world piece computers' every time, I will refer to the pair simply as 'piece computer'. Piece and peace are disambiguated by context, by articles 'a' (world) piece computer
